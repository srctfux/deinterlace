Instructions For New & Existing Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hello and welcome to the DScaler source.  There are a few hoops to jump through before the
source can be compiled.  Our guides will hopefully smooth that process.

For starters there are two supported compilers.  You can use either

1) Visual Studio 6
Follow the guide in ReadMe.VS6.txt

2) Visual Studio .NET 2003
Follow the guide in ReadMe.NET.txt

3) Visual Studio .NET 2005
Follow the guide in ReadMe.VS2005.txt

4) Visual Studio C++ Express Edition 2005
Follow the guide in ReadMe.VS2005.txt

Thanks

John Adcock
