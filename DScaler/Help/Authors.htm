<h2>John Adcock</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>John is the founder and maintainer of the project.  He did almost all of the work 
cleaning, translating and legalizing Multidec to create the first versions of dTV. 
He coded the world's first real-time software 3:2 pulldown software deinterlacer
(based on Mark Rejhon's algorithm article). He has also designed several 
video-material deinterlacers that are superior to those in
virtually any other any PC-based video software product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Mark Rejhon</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark authored the 3:2 pulldown algorithm that forms the basis
of the algorithm implemented into DScaler by John Adcock. He maintained the project
for three months and during that time made a huge contribution to the project.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Steve Grimm</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Steve is contributing enhancements to the deinterlacing modes
including better automatic switching between video mode and 3:2
pulldown mode, and handling of material that has bad 3:2
pulldown. In particular, Steve made significant modifications to
the deinterlacing algorithm in version 2.0.0. He also worked on
an early version of a 3:2 pulldown deinterlacing algorithm. In
addition, he is the author of the aspect ratio autodetection code
which was included in version 1.9.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Tom Barry</h2>

<blockquote>Tom contributed the triple buffering code and
synchronization fixes for version 2.0.0. Also, he has authored
several MMX assembly optimizations to the video deinterlace mode
and added the advanced Brooktree/Conexant chipset settings menu,
both of which were included in version 1.9.</blockquote>

<h2>Michael Samblanet</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Michael is continuing to upgrade his aspect ratio control
code.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Michael Eskin</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>An engineer working at Conexant Systems Inc., the makers of
the 8x8 series chips that DScaler runs on.  He basically
meditates peace between the DScaler software and the 8x8 video
capture hardware.  When any of us fails on a nasty 8x8 issue, he
takes over and gets the job done from time to time.  One of his
several valuable contributions include a bug fix to make
Macrovision-encoded sources watchable in DScaler, without
purple-lines interference.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Laurent Garnier</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite having really no link with the French DJ, he's the
latest one on the DScaler boat. He coded the auto detection of
WSS (WideScreen Signalling), improved the OSD with various
"status screens". He also did the popup menu, per-format settings
persistency. He's the second European coder, along with John
Adcock.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Torbj&ouml;rn Jansson</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Added the new generic settings dialog and has provided many
bug fixes</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Lindsey Dubb</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Provided the new Temporal Comb Filter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please see the <a href="Thanks.htm">Thanks</a> file for an
incomplete list of the many others who have contributed time and
effort.</p>
