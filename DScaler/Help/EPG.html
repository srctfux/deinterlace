      <p>This DScaler feature allows to display using OSD some information about the TV programmes.<br>





DScaler does not directly collect these data on-line. This task must be done by an external application.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p></p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Import an XMLTV file</b></font></p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p> Using the menu "Import XMLTV File", you can select on your
hard drive a XML file and import in DScaler the EPG data contained in
that file. That XML file must be compilant with the XMLTV DTD (either
0.5 or 0.6).</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p>To obtain that file, one solution is to use one of the&nbsp;grabbers
included in the XMLTV package. A grabber is a script that will access
a&nbsp;WEB site proposing the TV programmes, collect data relative to
the TV programmes and finally produce a XML file compliant to the XMLTV
DTD. This grab can require several hours depending on the number of
channels and how many days are grabbed.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p>One another solution, easier and faster, is to download directly on the WEB
that produced file containing EPG data. But of course that file must be
available on the WEB for your country (your TV channels).</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p></p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Import NextViewEPG database</b></font></p>







      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>NextViewEPG is an application that collects and
displays&nbsp;Electronic Program Guide broadcasted by certain TV
channels.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Using the menu "Import NextViewEPG database", you can&nbsp;import in DScaler the EPG data collected by NextViewEPG.</p>

      
      <p>DScaler determines automatically which are the available
providers in NextViewEPG and lets the user choose which one to consider
when several exist.
In order to avoid doing that choice everytime, an advanced DScaler
setting allows defining the default provider to be used. Nevertheless,
it is not possible to select and merge programmes from several providers</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Please note that NextViewEPG, when in acquisition mode, cannot be run&nbsp;at the
same time with DScaler
because both of the two software are controling your TV card. So the idea
is to run sometimes NextViewEPG alone to collect data and when it is
done, you exit NextViewEPG (or at least stop acquisition) and then run DScaler to import NextViewEPG
database. Depending on the used EPG provider, you could have the
description of all the programmes more or less in advance. So run
NextViewEPG to collect new data when you have no more EPG data
displayed in DScaler or when the description of programmes is missing.
EPG providers
often distribute the schedule of programmes for several coming days
(often 7 days) but the description of programmes description for only
coming hours.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p></p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Setup</b></font></p>







      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>To work correctly, you need to define a link between the
channel names you have defined in DScaler and the channel names defined
in the XMLTV file you have imported. You can update it using the
channel setup dialog box. For each channel, you can enter a name in the
field "EPG Name" which is different from the channel name used by
DScaler. By default, this is the same&nbsp;and that will probably be ok
for most of your channels.</p>



      
      
      
      <p>One way to verify the setup is to press the key G to display
the EPG
information in the OSD and then to go through all your channels one by
one, checking that the
programme information is displayed for every channel. If no EPG
information is found for a particular channel, press the key
Ctrl+Shift+G without filtering the channels (ChannelFiltering setting
set to OFF in the advanced DScaler settings) and try to find a
programme corresponding to that channel. If you find it, that means the
channel name displayed in the OSD is different from the channel name
defined in DScaler. Open the channel setup dialog box and update the
field "EPG Name" with the name you saw in the OSD. If you don't find
any programme for that channel, that means that channel is probably not
covered by the file you have imported.</p>



      
      
      
      <p>When you have finished the EPG setup, you can decide to
activate the channel filtering in the advanced settings so that
browsing programmes will display only the channels defined in DScaler.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p></p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Programme brwosing</b></font></p>







      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Program browsing is available using menus and/or keyboard
shortcuts. A new sub-menu dedicated to EPG has been created in the
"Actions" menu.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p>All EPG information are displayed using two different OSD screens.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p></p>




      
      
      
      
      <p>The first OSD screen allows to display detailed information but only for one particular programme:</p>




      
      
      
      
      <ul>




        <li>channel name</li>




        <li>start time</li>




        <li>end time</li>




        <li>percentage of completion</li>




        <li>title and sub-title</li>




        <li>description</li>




      
      
      
      
      </ul>




      
      
      
      
      <p>When you are looking at TV, you can press the key G to display
the detailed information of the programme you are currently looking at.
If the description does not fully enter in the screen, you can
scroll-down and scroll-up the description using the keys Shift+PgDn and
Shift+PgUp.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p>To see the detailed information of the later programme on the
same channel, you can press the key Shift+Up. To see the detailed
information of the earlier programme on the same channel, you can press
the key Shift+Dn. At any time, pressing G allows to come back to the
currently scheduled programme.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p></p>




      
      
      
      
      <p>The second OSD screen allows to display basic information for several programmes:</p>




      
      
      
      
      <ul>




        <li>channel name</li>




        <li>category</li>




        <li>start time</li>




        <li>end time</li>




        <li>percentage of completion</li>




        <li>title</li>




      
      
      
      
      </ul>




      
      
      
      
      <p>In that OSD screen, the programme having its title in orange
is the programme currently selected and the programme having its time
information in blue is the programme you are currently looking at. The
percentage of completion is displayed only for the programmes currently scheduled.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p>To&nbsp;display that OSD screen and select all the programmes
scheduled during the coming hour, you can press the
key Ctrl+Shift+G. If there are more selected programmes than what can
be displayed on screen, several pages are created and you can use the
keys Shift+PgDn and Shift+PgUp to go to the next and previous page. At
the top right of the screen, you have an information telling you how
many programmes belongs to your current selection and which ones are
currently displayed on screen. There are two choices of sorting for
these programmes, depending on an advanced DScaler setting: either by
programme start time (default behaviour), or first by channel order
(DScaler order) and then by programme start time.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p>The programme with the&nbsp;title in orange is the current
programme of your selection. You can use the keys Shift+Up and Shift+Dn
to change it and go to the next and previous programme of your
selection. To switch to the first OSD screen and display the detailed
information about that programme, you can press the key G. To return to
the previous screen, use the key Ctrl+Shift+G.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p>At any time, you can switch and show the current programme of your selection. Just press the key Shift+Enter. </p>




      
      
      
      
      <p>Using the new menu, you can select a specific day (from
yesterday until six days after today) and a specific start time inside
that day. By default, your selection contains all the programmes
covering one hour. You can change your selection and shift to the
previous or next hour using the keysCtrl+G and Shift+G. For example, if
time is 04:15pm, pressing Ctrl+Shift+G shows first programmes covering
the time frame between 04:15pm and 05:14pm. Pressing Shift+G will then
display programmes covering the time frame betwwen 05:00pm and 05:59pm.
Pressing Shift+G again will then display programmes covering the time
frame betwwen 06:00pm and 06:59pm. Pressing Ctrl+G will then return to
the previous hour and display&nbsp;programmes covering the time frame betwwen 05:00pm and 05:59pm.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p></p>


      
      
      <p>To hide one of the EPG OSD screens, just press the key
BackSpace. Nevertheless, an advanced DScaler setting allows switching G
and Ctrl+Shift+G as toggle keys, meaning a successive action on the key
shows and then hides&nbsp;the EPG OSD screen.</p>
