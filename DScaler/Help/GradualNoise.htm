<p>This filter cleans up the picture, averaging out visual noise between frames.</p>

<p>When colors change just a little, the filter decides that it's probably noise,
and only slightly changes the color from the previous frame. As the change in color
increases, the filter becomes more and more convinced that the change is due to motion
rather than noise -- and the new color gets more and more weight.</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" font color="#993300">Noise Reduction</font></b></p>

<p>There's just one setting -- <font color="#993300">Noise Reduction</font>.</p>

<P>The higher you set it, the more you'll cut down on noise -- but the more blurring you will see.
In general, reasonable settings range from 10 (to soften the occasional speckle without
artifacts) to 80 (to average out really heavy noise at the cost of bad
blurring). I prefer somewhere between 25 (to reduce noise with minimal artifacts) and 45
(for better reduction, but visible blurring)
At extremely high <font color="#993300">Noise Reduction</font> values, you'll start to see artifactual vertical lines.</P>

<p>To choose a setting for it, turn on just about any sitcom -- anything with moving faces. Increase
<font color="#993300">Noise Reduction</font> until the suppression of noise doesn't
seem worth the blur.</p>

<p>(Faces are a good place to check for blur because we're especially sensitive
to distortion there.)</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Fun With Noise<font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Should I use a noise filter?</font></b></p>

<p>That depends on what you're watching. With sports or nature shows --
really anything with lots of moving low contrast texture -- you
should turn the noise filter off.  That's
because the filters are fooled by grass fields, which to a dumb
computer look just like noise.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you generally should have a noise filter running.</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">How much noise reduction should I use?</font></b></p>

<P>Let your eyes be the judge. I like to keep the settings pretty
low -- Blurred faces look worse than a little static.</p>

<P>Surprisingly, small amounts of color variation can sometimes improve an image.  By
switching back and forth between colors, the picture is able to give
the impression of a color somewhere in between them. Also, noise can
break up artifactual patterns in the picture, making it easier for you to ignore
the errors.</p>

<P>With that in mind, the Gradual Noise Filter tries to preserve a
small amount of color variation. As a result, it will never give you a completely
stable picture.</P>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Which noise filter should I use?</font></b></p>

<P>If your computer is older than a Pentium 3, Athlon, or some recent
Celerons, the Gradual Noise Filter won't show up in the menu -- because
it can't run.  In that case, you should
use the <A HREF="Noise.htm">Temporal Noise Filter</A>, which works fine on
older computers. Even if you can run either filter, Temporal Noise is slightly
faster -- It uses roughly 150MHz as opposed to the Gradual Noise
Filter's 175MHz.</P>

<P>If you can spare the CPU time, the choice is a matter of taste.  The
Temporal Noise Filter will give you a more solid picture.  The
Gradual Noise Filter tends to have less speckling and posterization
and better color depth. Watch both and choose your favorite.</p>

<p>Don't run the Temporal Noise Filter and the Gradual Noise Filter
at the same time. It looks awful.</p>
