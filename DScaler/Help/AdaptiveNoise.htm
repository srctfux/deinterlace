This is yet another filter which cleans up the picture, averaging out visual noise between frames.
</p>

<P>
The filter is designed to cope with the oddities of broad&shy;cast TV.  It auto&shy;matic&shy;ally
fine tunes itself for good or poor quality
signal and recep&shy;tion, and can even deal reason&shy;ably with some kinds of inter&shy;ference. It&rsquo;s spiffy!
</P>

<P>
The Adaptive Noise filter examines the image, infers the amount of noise in the picture, and uses
that esti&shy;mate to de&shy;termine how to cancel the noise.  
To dif&shy;feren&shy;tiate between noise and motion, the filter makes use of cor&shy;rela&shy;tions within and between
fields as well as local color differ&shy;ences.  As with the <A HREF="GradualNoise.htm">Gradual Noise Filter</A>, the degree
of cer&shy;tainty about motion and noise is used to decide what mix of the previous and current colors to show.

<p><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">
Noise Reduction
</font></b></p>

<P>
Sometimes the filter doesn&rsquo;t know whether change in the picture comes from noise or motion.
When that happens, there&rsquo;s a tradeoff&nbsp;&mdash; Guess motion, and the picture will be
noisier if you&rsquo;re wrong.  Guess noise, and a mistake will blur the movement.
</P>

<P>
The <font color = "#993300">Noise Reduc&shy;tion</font> setting lets you tell the filter how to make this trade&shy;off.
Set it low, and the computer will play it safe, avoid&shy;ing any parts of the image which might be in motion.  Set
it high, and noise will be greatly reduced&nbsp;&mdash; at the cost of blur&shy;ring and loss of detail in slowly moving areas.
This trade&shy;off is affected by the amount of noise&nbsp;&mdash; The more noise there is in the image, the more blur&shy;ring
will be neces&shy;sary in order to reduce it.
</P>

<P>
There&rsquo;s no perfect way to choose this&nbsp;&mdash; Just move the slider until it looks as nice as possible.  Comedies and
dramas are prob&shy;ably the best material for picking settings, since facial close&shy;ups make any blur&shy;ring really easy
to see.  (That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re especially good at seeing distor&shy;tion in faces.)
</P>

<P>
Before you fine tune this setting, make sure that the filter has adapted to the current signal.  To do so, make use of
the <font color = "#993300">Lock Dot</font>, described below.
</P>

<p><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">
Stability
</font></b></p>

<P>
To preserve a small amount of noise through&shy;out the picture, move this setting down. To get a really solid looking picture,
move it up.  Don&rsquo;t set it too high, though, or you&rsquo;ll get poster&shy;ization.
</P>

<P>
Regardless of your <font color = "#993300">Stability</font> setting, the filter will always preserve a certain amount
of vari&shy;ation in order to main&shy;tain the color depth of the orig&shy;inal image.
</P>


<p><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">
Lock Dot
</font></b></p>

<P>
It&rsquo;s... a small green dot!
</P>

<P>
Check this setting, and a tiny green dot will appear toward the upper
left of the screen when the filter&rsquo;s esti&shy;mate of the noise is confirmed by the current picture.  That&rsquo;s
an indic&shy;ation that the filter has settled on a noise value.  In general, the dot will turn off
when all of the picture is in rapid motion&nbsp;&mdash; When there&rsquo;s too much motion, the
filter tends not to believe the current esti&shy;mate.  In that case,
the filter makes do by weight&shy;ing previous good values.
</P>

<P>
If the picture is con&shy;stantly in motion, it&rsquo;ll take a while before the filter can figure out the noise level. 
Inter&shy;ference also tends to make noise esti&shy;mation take longer&nbsp;&mdash; The esti&shy;mation time depends on the kind and
amount of the inter&shy;ference.
</P>


<P>
If all else fails, tune to the signal with the inter&shy;ference, then quit and restart DScaler.  The Adap&shy;tive
Noise Filter is more tolerant of inter&shy;ference right after it starts up, before it has seen a clean signal
from another source. But with certain kinds of heavy inter&shy;ference, the filter will <EM>never</EM> be able
to figure out the noise level.  In that case, the <A HREF="Noise.HTM">Temporal Noise Filter</A> is probably
your best bet.

<p><b><A NAME="Fun With Noise"><font face="Arial" size="4">
Fun With Noise
<font></A></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">
What&rsquo;s the best way to get rid of noise?
</font></b></p>

<P>
Make sure you have a good signal.  Noise can come from cable jumbles, poor connec&shy;tions, poor
power and ground&shy;ing,
poorly designed video input cards, elec&shy;trical gadgets (anything from a dimmer switch to various computer compon&shy;ents)
or from a bad video source.  These issues are all beyond the scope of this help file.  I&rsquo;d suggest
a look at the <A HREF="http://www.avsforum.com/">AV Science Forum</A>&rsquo;s Home Theater Computers
board, where these topics are often dis&shy;cussed at length.


<p><b><font face="Arial">
Should I use a noise filter?
</font></b></p>

<p>
It depends what you&rsquo;re watching.  Sports and nature shows in general&nbsp;&mdash;
really anything with lots of moving low contrast texture&nbsp;&mdash; are not handled
well by the current noise filters.  That&rsquo;s because those textures look a lot like noise.
</P>

<P>
The Adap&shy;tive filter does the best with dif&shy;ficult material, dis&shy;abling itself
where it detects motion.  It does surpris&shy;ingly well with field sports so long as
the back&shy;ground noise isn&rsquo;t too bad.  But it isn&rsquo;t
perfect&nbsp;&mdash; Road races are especially prone to blur&shy;ring.
When that happens, it&rsquo;s best to turn the filter off.
</p>

<p>Otherwise, you generally should have a noise filter running.</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">
How much noise reduction should I use?
</font></b></p>

<P>
Let your eyes be the judge. I like to keep the set&shy;tings pretty
low&nbsp;&mdash; Blur&shy;red faces look worse than a little static.
</p>

<P>
Surprisingly, small amounts of color vari&shy;ation can some&shy;times improve an image.  By
switch&shy;ing back and forth between colors, the picture is able to give
the impres&shy;sion of a color some&shy;where in between them. Also, noise can
break up arti&shy;factual patterns in the picture, making it easier for you to ignore
the errors.
</p>

<P>
With that in mind, the Adap&shy;tive and Gradual Noise Filters and the Greedy (High Motion) median filter all try to preserve a
small amount of color vari&shy;ation. As a result, they will never give you a com&shy;pletely
stable picture.
</P>

<p><b><font face="Arial">
Which noise filter should I use?
</font></b></p>

<P>
If your computer is older than a Pentium 3, Athlon, or some recent
Celerons, the Adap&shy;tive and <A HREF="GradualNoise.htm">Gradual Noise</A> filters won&rsquo;t
show up in the menu&nbsp;&mdash; because
they can&rsquo;t run.  In that case, you should
use the <A HREF="Noise.htm">Temporal Noise Filter</A>, which works fine on
older compu&shy;ters. If you can run any filter, Temporal Noise and Gradual Noise
are roughly the same speed at about 150 MHz.  The Adaptive Noise Filter is
much slower, using about 300 MHz.
</P>

<P>
The Temp&shy;oral Noise Filter can give you a very solid picture.  The
Gradual Noise Filter doesn&rsquo;t look as solid, but has less speck&shy;ling and poster&shy;ization
and better color depth. The Adap&shy;tive Noise Filter has a solid
picture (if you want it), avoids speck&shy;ling, color artifacts and poster&shy;ization, and
corrects for varying levels of noise.  (Yes, it&rsquo;s my favorite.  But I wrote it, so I&rsquo;m biased.)
With a poor signal, the Adap&shy;tive filter
can take a while to stabil&shy;ize on a good picture, which can be annoying.
</p>

<p>
A fourth choice is an option hidden in the <A HREF="GreedyH.HTM">Greedy (High Motion)</A> 
de&shy;interlac&shy;ing method. One of its abilities is a median filter, which works well
for mild noise reduc&shy;tion with minimal harm to the picture.  It delays the picture a little,
making use of colors in upcoming fields in order to figure out how to reduce noise.
The median filter is very slow (taking about 600 MHz), but you get
excellent de&shy;interlac&shy;ing as well as the noise reduc&shy;tion.
<p>

<p>
In general, the more noise filters you run at once, the <EM>worse</EM> the picture will get. In partic&shy;ular,
don&rsquo;t run the Temp&shy;oral Noise Filter at the same time as the Gradual Noise or Adap&shy;tive Noise filters. It looks awful.
</p>


<p><b><font face="Arial">
Will any of the filters get rid of those annoying vert&shy;ical noise bars?

No.
