<p>
This is yet another filter which cleans up the picture, averaging out visual noise between frames.
</p>

<P>
The filter is designed to cope with the oddities of broadcast TV.  It automatically fine tunes itself for good or poor quality
signal and reception, and can even deal reasonably with some kinds of interference. It's spiffy!
</P>

<P>
The Adaptive Noise filter examines the image, infers the amount of noise in the picture, and uses that estimate to
determine how to cancel the noise.  
To differentiate between noise and motion, the filter makes use of correlations within and between
fields as well as local color differences.  As with the <A HREF="GradualNoise.htm">Gradual Noise Filter</A>, the degree of certainty about motion
and noise is used to decide what mix of the previous and current colors to show.
</P>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">
The Settings
</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">
Noise Reduction
</font></b></p>

<P>
Sometimes the filter doesn't know whether change in the picture comes from noise or motion.  When that happens, there's a
tradeoff -- Guess motion, and the picture will be noisier if you're wrong.  Guess noise, and a mistake will blur the movement.
</P>

<P>
The <font color = "#993300">Noise Reduction</font> setting lets you tell the filter how to make this tradeoff.  Set it low, and the computer will play it
safe, avoiding any parts of the image which might be in motion.  Set it high, and noise will be greatly reduced -- at the cost of blurring and
loss of detail in slowly moving areas.  This tradeoff is affected by the amount of noise -- The more noise there is in the image, the more blurring
will be necessary in order to reduce it.
</P>

<P>
There's no right way to choose this -- Just move the slider until it looks as nice as possible.  Comedies and dramas are probably the best material
for choosing settings, since facial closeups make any blurring really easy to see.  (That's because we're especially good at seeing distortion in faces.)
</P>


<P>
Before you fine tune this setting, make sure that the filter has adapted to the current signal.  To do so, make use of
the <font color = "#993300">Lock Dot</font>, described below.
</P>

<p><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">
Stability
</font></b></p>

<P>
To get a really solid looking picture, move this setting up.  To preserve a small amount of noise throughout the picture, move it down. 
As with <font color = "#993300">Noise Reduction</font>, this is entirely a matter of taste.
</P>

<P>
Regardless of your <font color = "#993300">Stability</font> setting, the filter will always preserve a certain amount of variation in order to maintain the
color depth of the original image.
</P>


<p><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">
Lock Dot
</font></b></p>

<P>
It's... a small green dot!
</P>

<P>
Check this setting, and a tiny green dot will appear toward the upper
left of the screen when the filter's estimate of the noise is confirmed by the current picture.  That's an indication that the filter
has settled on a noise value.  In general, the dot will turn off
when all of the picture is in rapid motion -- When there's too much motion, the
filter tends not to believe the current estimate.  In that case,
the filter makes do by weighting previous good values.
</P>

<P>
If the picture is constantly in motion, it'll take a while before the filter can figure out the noise level.  Interference also tends to
make noise estimation take longer -- The estimation time depends on the kind and amount of the interference.
</P>


<P>
If all else fails, tune to the signal with the interference, then quit and restart DScaler.  The Adaptive Noise Filter is more
tolerant of interference right after it starts up, before it has seen a clean signal from another source.
But with certain kinds of
heavy interference, the filter will <EM>never</EM> be able to figure out the noise level.  In that case, the <A HREF="Noise.HTM">Temporal Noise
Filter</A> is probably your best bet.

<p><b><A NAME="Fun With Noise"><font face="Arial" size="4">
Fun With Noise
<font></A></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">
What's the best way to get rid of noise?
</font></b></p>

<P>
Make sure you have a good signal.  Noise can come from cable jumbles, poor connections, poor
power and grounding,
poorly designed video input cards, electrical gadgets (anything from a dimmer switch to various computer components)
or from a bad video source.  These issues are all beyond the scope of this help file.  I'd suggest
a look at the <A HREF="http://www.avsforum.com/">AV Science Forum</A>'s Home Theater Computers
board, where these topics are often discussed at length.


<p><b><font face="Arial">
Should I use a noise filter?
</font></b></p>

<p>
It depends what you're watching.  Sports and nature shows in general --
really anything with lots of moving low contrast texture -- are not handled
well by the current noise filters.  That's because those textures look a lot like noise.
</P>

<P>
The Adaptive filter does the best with difficult material, disabling itself
where it detects motion.  It does surprisingly well with field sports so long as
the background noise isn't too bad.  But it isn't
perfect -- Road races are especially prone to blurring.
When that happens, it's best to turn the filter off.
</p>

<p>Otherwise, you generally should have a noise filter running.</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">
How much noise reduction should I use?
</font></b></p>

<P>
Let your eyes be the judge. I like to keep the settings pretty
low -- Blurred faces look worse than a little static.
</p>

<P>
Surprisingly, small amounts of color variation can sometimes improve an image.  By
switching back and forth between colors, the picture is able to give
the impression of a color somewhere in between them. Also, noise can
break up artifactual patterns in the picture, making it easier for you to ignore
the errors.
</p>

<P>
With that in mind, the Adaptive and Gradual Noise Filters and the Greedy (High Motion) median filter all try to preserve a
small amount of color variation. As a result, they will never give you a completely
stable picture.
</P>

<p><b><font face="Arial">
Which noise filter should I use?
</font></b></p>

<P>
If your computer is older than a Pentium 3, Athlon, or some recent
Celerons, the Adaptive and <A HREF="GradualNoise.htm">Gradual Noise</A> filters won't show up in the menu -- because
they can't run.  In that case, you should
use the <A HREF="Noise.htm">Temporal Noise Filter</A>, which works fine on
older computers. If you can run any filter, Temporal Noise and Gradual Noise
are roughly the same speed at about 150 MHz.  The Adaptive Noise Filter is
much slower, using about 300 MHz.
</P>

<P>
The Temporal Noise Filter can give you a very solid picture.  The
Gradual Noise Filter doesn't look as solid, but has less speckling and posterization
and better color depth. The Adaptive Noise Filter has a solid
picture (if you want it), avoids speckling, color artifacts and posterization, and
corrects for varying levels of noise.  (Yes, it's my favorite.  But I wrote it, so I'm biased.)
With a poor signal, the Adaptive filter
can take a while to stabilize on a good picture, which can be annoying.
</p>

<p>
A fourth choice is an option hidden in the <A HREF="GreedyH.HTM">Greedy (High Motion)</A> 
deinterlacing method. One of its abilities is a median filter, which works well
for mild noise reduction with minimal harm to the picture.  It delays the picture a little,
making use of colors in upcoming fields in order to figure out how to reduce noise.
The median filter is very slow (taking about 600 MHz), but you get
excellent deinterlacing as well as the noise reduction.
<p>

<p>
In general, the more noise filters you run at once, the <EM>worse</EM> the picture will get. In particular,
don't run the Temporal Noise Filter at the same time as the Gradual Noise or Adaptive Noise filters. It looks awful.
</p>


<p><b><font face="Arial">
Will any of the filters get rid of those annoying vertical noise bars?
</font></b></p>

<P>
No.
