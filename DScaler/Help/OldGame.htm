<p>
This method improves the display of video games from old
consoles on your computer. Instead of de&shy;interlac&shy;ing like most
DScaler methods, it smoothes verti&shy;cally. That gets rid of the
block&shy;iness you&rsquo;d other&shy;wise see. It works nicely with just
about any game on a Play&shy;Station, Super Nin&shy;tendo, or Genesis.
Presum&shy;ably, it will work well with a Nin&shy;tendo 64, Saturn, Atari,
NES, Mega&shy;drive, and so on. Just don&rsquo;t try it with your
Vectrex.
</p>

<p>
More exactly, this method assumes that you&rsquo;re look&shy;ing at a
progres&shy;sive half vertical resolu&shy;tion image. So any video source which fits
that descrip&shy;tion should work well. The Old Game method is similar
to <A HREF="OddOnly.HTM">Odd Scan&shy;lines Only</A> and
<A HREF="EvenOnly.HTM">Even Scan&shy;lines Only</A>, but improves the picture in
a couple ways. First, it works well with material running at any
FPS (frames per second) rate, instead of just 25 or 30 FPS.
Second, it option&shy;ally uses averag&shy;ing between frames to reduce
noise and color cross&shy;talk. The averag&shy;ing works well alone or along with a noise
filter.
</p>

<p>
Later consoles such as the Dream&shy;cast, Play&shy;Station 2, Game&shy;Cube,
or XBox use inter&shy;laced output, and will look lousy with this
de&shy;interlac&shy;ing method. (Well, some of them allow progres&shy;sive output, too, but
not in a way the sup&shy;ported input cards can under&shy;stand.) To play
them on your computer, use the more standard <A HREF="Deinterlace.HTM">deinterlac&shy;ing
methods</A>&nbsp;&mdash; or better yet, find a VGA adaptor. The Super
Nin&shy;tendo, Play&shy;Station, Nin&shy;tendo 64, and Saturn
can also use an inter&shy;laced mode. The Play&shy;Station uses interlaced
mode for its start&shy;up logo, for example. But almost all games
switch back into progres&shy;sive half vertical resolu&shy;tion mode for the main play
of the game. Auto&shy;matic sensing of the inter&shy;lace mode is some&shy;thing
I&rsquo;d like to add in the future.

Who Should Use It?
</font></b></p>

<p>
Anybody who plays old video games on their computer via video
input should use this de&shy;interlac&shy;ing method. (Well, at least until some&shy;thing
better comes along.)
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s a bug in some older Matrox overlay drivers which
allows the <A HREF="ScalerBob.HTM">Scaler Bob</A> method to work nearly as well as Old Game
for progres&shy;sive half vertical resolu&shy;tion video. It doesn&rsquo;t use averag&shy;ing to
reduce noise, but it should run a little faster. On the other
hand, Old Game is fast enough to run just fine on any
computer sup&shy;ported by DScaler, so that doesn&rsquo;t really get you
much.
</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">
The Settings
</font></b></p>

<p>
There are two options to set for this method, <font color = "#993300">Compos&shy;ite Mode</font>
and <font color = "#993300">Motion Threshold</font>. <font color = "#993300">Compos&shy;ite Mode</font>
forces the method to always average between frames. <font color = "#993300">Motion Threshold</font>
is the amount of motion (in arbi&shy;trary units) which will con&shy;vince the method not to
average between frames.
</p>

<p>
The way you should set these options depends on the way you&rsquo;ve connected your console.
</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">
Composite or F-Connector
</font></b></p>

<p>
With a composite connection, the biggest problem by far will
be color crosstalk. To get rid of it, check
<font color = "#993300">Compos&shy;ite Mode</font>. That way, the crosstalk will be
averaged out. This makes the picture look much, much nicer.
</p>

<p>
With <font color = "#993300">Composite Mode</font> checked, the <font color = "#993300">Motion Threshold</font> slider won&rsquo;t
do anything at all.
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, the <A HREF="TemporalComb.htm">Tempo&shy;ral Comb</A> filter doesn&rsquo;t help at all for
cross&shy;talk in most old video games. That&rsquo;s for an obscure
tech&shy;nical reason involv&shy;ing the phase of the color carrier signal
and the number of scan lines per frame.
</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">
S-video
</font></b></p>

<p>
With an S-video con&shy;nection, you shouldn&rsquo;t see much color
cross&shy;talk. So you can afford to set the slider to prevent
averag&shy;ing when the scene is moving. Turn off <font color = "#993300">Compos&shy;ite Mode</font>
and put the <font color = "#993300">Motion Threshold</font> at about 300. Increase it a bit
if you have a noisy picture (and turn on a noise filter), or
decrease it if you see blur&shy;ring with fast motion.
