<p>This method improves the display of video games from old
consoles on your computer. Instead of deinterlacing like most
DScaler methods, it smooths vertically. That gets rid of the
blockiness you'd otherwise see. It works nicely with just
about any game on a PlayStation, Super Nintendo, or Genesis.
Presumably, it will work well with a Nintendo 64, Saturn, Atari,
NES, Megadrive, and so on. Just don't try it with your
Vectrex.</p>

<p>More exactly, this method assumes that you're looking at a
progressive half vertical resolution image. So any video source which fits
that description should work well. The Old Game method is similar
to <A HREF="OddOnly.HTM">OddOnly</A> and <A HREF="EvenOnly.HTM">EvenOnly</A>, but improves the picture in
a couple ways. First, it works well with material running at any
FPS (frames per second) rate, instead of just 25 or 30 FPS.
Second, it optionally uses averaging between frames to reduce
noise and color crosstalk. The averaging works well alone or along with a noise
filter.</p>

<p>Later consoles such as the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, GameCube,
or XBox use interlaced output, and will look lousy with this
plugin. (Well, some of them allow progressive output, too, but
not in a way the supported input cards can understand.) To play
them on your computer, use the more standard deinterlacing
plugins -- or better yet, find a VGA adaptor. The Super Nintendo, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Saturn
can also use an interlaced mode. The PlayStation uses interlaced
mode for its startup logo, for example. But almost all games
switch back into progressive half vertical resolution mode for the main play
of the game. Automatic sensing of the interlace mode is something
I'd like to add in the future.</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Who Should Use
It?</font></b></p>

<p>Anybody who plays old video games on their computer via video
input should use this plugin. (Well, at least until something
better comes along.)</p>

<p>There's a bug in some older Matrox overlay drivers which
allows the Scaler Bob plugin to work nearly as well as Old Game
for progressive half vertical resolution video. It doesn't use averaging to
reduce noise, but it should run a little faster. On the other
hand, Old Game is fast enough to run just fine on any
computer supported by DScaler, so that doesn't really get you
much.</p>

<HR>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">The Settings</font></b></p>

<p>There are two options to set for this plugin, <font color = "#993300">Composite Mode</font>
and <font color = "#993300">Motion Threshold</font>. <font color = "#993300">Composite Mode</font> forces the plugin to always
average between frames. <font color = "#993300">Motion Threshold</font> is the amount of motion
(in arbitrary units) which will convince the plugin not to
average between frames.</p>

<p>The way you should set these options depends on the way you've
connected your console.</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Composite or F-Connector</font></b></p>

<p>With a composite connection, the biggest problem by far will
be color crosstalk. To get rid of it, check
<font color = "#993300">Composite Mode</font>. That way, the crosstalk will be
averaged out. This makes the picture look much, much nicer.</p>

<p>With <font color = "#993300">Composite Mode</font> checked, the <font color = "#993300">Motion Threshold</font> slider won't
do anything at all.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the <A HREF="TemporalComb.htm">Temporal Comb</A> filter doesn't help at all for
crosstalk in most old video games. That's for an obscure
technical reason involving the phase of the color carrier signal
and the number of scanlines per frame.</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">S-video</font></b></p>

<p>With an S-video connection, you shouldn't see much color
crosstalk. So you can afford to set the slider to prevent
averaging when the scene is moving. Turn off <font color = "#993300">Composite Mode</font>
and put the <font color = "#993300">Motion Threshold</font> at about 300. Increase it a bit
if you have a noisy picture (and turn on a noise filter), or
decrease it if you see blurring with fast motion.</p>
