<p>WHAT IT DOES: (Basic)</p>

<p>The plugin works at two different levels. By default, at the
Basic Level, it is a normal DScaler deinterlace method, with the
following features:</p>

<p>- A merge of Blended Clip, Greedy (Low Motion), and some new
stuff</p>

<p>- Greedy implied pulldown, like the Greedy (Low Motion)
method</p>

<p>- Parm blending like the Blended Clip method, for less
sizzling.</p>

<p>- Lookahead motion detection</p>

<p>- Diagonal Jaggie Reduction (DJR ;-) ) to smooth out the stair
step effect in moving diagonal lines. This is accomplish by
horizontally smoothing only the rapidly moving pixels, leaving
the stationary ones alone. If a diagonal edge is not moving then
it won't be jagged anyway under Greedy (High Motion). I've
previously somewhere here posted a couple snaps of some hard to
handle Video Essentials scenes off my test machine and a $135
non-progressive DVD player. See <a href=
"http://www.trbarry.com/Flag.tif" target="_blank">the Flag</a>
and <a href="http://www.trbarry.com/Lights.tif" target=
"_blank">the Lampposts</a> .</p>

<p>- Slider adjustments for Max Comb, Motion Threshold, and
Motion Sensitivity. However the defaults should be okay for most
cases.</p>

<p>- Basic Level is compatible with all MMX, Pentium II, AMD
K6-II, K6-III, Celeron and above machines. Performance will
probably be about that of the Greedy (2-Frame) method.</p>

<p><br>
WHAT IT DOES: (Advanced)</p>

<p>There is also an Advanced Level (experimental) which is
invoked if you check any of the boxes in the Method UI panel. You
won't be able to do this unless you are running a machine
supporting the Intel SSE instruction set (only integer SSE
instructions are needed). The Advanced options should run on
Athlons, Intel P-III, P4, and the faster Celerons.</p>

<p>When using the Advanced Features Greedy (HM) maintains its own
internal history of the last 4 video input fields. This means it
must be able to examine every field and you can't use it at the
same time as DScaler's regular Auto_Pulldown option. So if you
are going to use the advanced options, please first be sure the
Settings/Deinterlace/Auto_Pulldown option is not checked.</p>

<p>Using the Advanced Options is also very sensitive to machine
performance and dropped frames, so you may have to lower your
Settings/Pixel_Width to 640 if you get jerkiness. It's also best
to have Hurry_When_Late=0 in the DScaler.ini file.</p>

<p>The new check box enabled features are:</p>

<p>- Built in 3:2, 2:2, an n:m Pulldown. This does pulldown
matching, not removal, so all frames are displayed. I think this
eventually will work better with video overlays and live TV
viewing that is extensively edited, but it still needs
improvement.</p>

<p>- In-Between Frames. This gives judder reduction for those of
us with fixed 60 HZ RTPV's. In a 3:2 pulldown situation it will
select an appropriate pair of fields to average once out of every
5 frames. This can effectively display every new input frame 2
1/2 times. It will cause a small amount of motion blur every
fifth frame but I personally leave it turned on all the time now
for a smoother film picture sequence. It will also work with 2:2
pulldown (I think) but there one half of the frames will be
averaged and the motion blur may not be acceptable.</p>

<p>- Adjustable Edge Enhancement. This is due to an idea posted
by this forum's MR. Wigggles. It enhances only a small amount, on
the horizontal axis. When turned on you can use a slider to
adjust it.</p>

<p>- Adjustable Median Filter. Also due to Mr. Wigggles, this can
help filter noise. However if set over about 3-5 it will also
cause motion artifacts on fast moving scenes. Also has a
slider.</p>

<p>- Vertical Filter. This is a post-deinterlace software
vertical filter that can remove both noise and some leftover
deinterlace artifacts. It gives results similar to the hardware
version available on the Advanced Video Flags screen, but not so
extreme and without the jitter.</p>
