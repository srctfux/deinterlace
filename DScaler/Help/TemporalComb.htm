<p>This filter removes dot crawl and some kinds of shimmering.
The effect is most noticable on computer generated images like
subtitles, weather maps, and station logos using a composite
video signal.</p> 

<p>What the heck is a comb filter? In technical terms, it
averages out chrominance/luminance crosstalk caused by imperfect
separation from a composite signal. It's called a "comb" for a
really obscure reason -- because the frequency response looks a
(very little) bit like a comb. Apparently, signal processing
engineers are obsessed with grooming.</p>

example of the problem, taken from a US Cable TV broadcast with an internal tuner. There's

</TR></TBODY></TABLE>


<p>But despite these examples, there's also plenty of low
contrast material for which the Temporal Comb Filter does very little
(except keep your processor busy).</p>

<p>Note that this filter is not in any way related to "comb" in
the sense used by many video folks! It's not supposed to reduce
weave artifacts (lagging horizontal lines) at all.</p>

<p>This comb filter only works temporally, not spatially. That
means dot crawl on moving backgrounds won't be corrected.</p>

<HR>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Who Should Use
It?</font></b></p>

<p>This filter is pretty slow, using roughly 350 MHz of processor time. So
unless you've got a Pentium 3, Athlon, or better, it's probably not worth the cost.</p>

<p>If your computer is fast enough, you should run the comb filter
whenever you're watching a composite signal.  That's
what you have if you're using an internal TV tuner or an RCA connector.
It also helps a little with shimmering from an S-Video signal -- but you can probably find
something more productive to keep your processor busy.</p>

<p>The comb filter doesn't help at all with video from old consoles
like the Super Nintendo or original PlayStation.  To get rid of
color crosstalk from older consoles, turn off this filter and use
the <A HREF="OldGame.htm">Old Game</A> deinterlacer, instead.</p>

<HR>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">The Settings</font></b></p>

<p>I'm going to describe how to configure this plugin
conservatively, so you can forget about it afterward. If you like
to fiddle with sliders, you can instead use much more aggressive
settings (lower <font color = "#993300">Recall</font> and
<font color = "#993300">Shimmering</font> values) and turn them up
only when you have to.</p>

<p><A NAME="Recall"><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">Recall of past shimmering</font></b></A></p>

<p>This is the really important setting. It decides just how far
back into the past the filter will look in order to confirm that
there's really some shimmering going on. Set it high (above 75%)
to avoid artifacts in scenes with repetitive motion. But don't
set it too high (above 95%), or it'll take a long time for the
filter to kick in.</p>

<p><A NAME="Shimmering"><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">Shimmering to activate</font></b></A></p>

<p>This setting has a much subtler effect. If you set it high,
the filter will only correct when there has been uninterrupted
shimmering. Set it low, and the filter will tolerate more
interruptions -- but will also be a little more susceptible to
artifacts.</p>

<p>If you're running a noise filter, too, you can afford to set
this low -- 30% works well for me. That's a good idea, since it
will allow the filter to correct more subtle shimmering. Without
a noise filter, you'll need to set it pretty high (about 70%) to
avoid transient spots where dot crawl has just disappeared. If
you don't care about shimmering and just want to take care of dot
crawl, you can safely set this near 100%.</p>

<p><A NAME="ColorDifferences"><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">Maximum in phase luminance (and chroma)
differences</font></b></A></p>

<p>These options let you decide just how different a color can be
before the plugin decides that the difference must be due to
motion. They can be set much higher than for the <A HREF="Noise.htm">Temporal Noise
Filter</A>, since this plugin uses a stricter motion detection
method. If you've enabled Even Luma Peaking and Odd Luma Peaking
(in the Advanced Video Flags dialog), you'll need to set these
very high -- to 45 or 50, each. With peaking disabled, you can
keep them much lower -- around 35 with my setup. You can lower
the settings by about 10 points apiece if you turn on <font color = "#993300">Trade Speed
for Accuracy</font>.</p>

<p>The higher the settings are, the more likely you
are to see transient spots. So if you put these really high,
you'll want to increase <font color = "#993300">Recall</font>
and/or <font color = "#993300">Shimmering</font>.</p>

<p>Here's how to optimize them:</p>

<p>- First, tune in the worst dot crawl you can find. In the US,
CNN Headlines is a dependable source, as are the "T" in the
Country Music Station's logo and the radar maps on the Weather
Channel. If you've got a video reference DVD, connect it via
composite and show a still with neighboring green and magenta
color bars.</p>

<p>- Turn <font color = "#993300">Recall</font> and <font color = "#993300">Shimmering</font> all the way down.
Turn the <font color = "#993300">In Phase Difference</font> settings up really high (about 80).
The dot crawl should disappear. (Well, bad dot crawl does still
leave a residual shimmer unless you enable <font color = "#993300">Trade Speed for
Accuracy</font>.)</p>

<p>- Move the two <font color = "#993300">in phase differences</font> down until the dot crawl
returns. Then raise the settings until the dot crawl disappears,
again. You've now got yourself the minimum values for those
sliders.</p>

<p>- Turn <font color = "#993300">Recall</font> and
<font color = "#993300">Shimmering</font> back up to more reasonable
values.</p>

<p><A NAME="SpeedForAccuracy"><b><font face="Arial" font color = "#993300">Trade speed for
accuracy</font></b></A></p>

<p>This checkbox does pretty much what it says. It improves the
accuracy and colors -- but slows things down a little, and uses an
additional 2 MB of memory (on top of the ~400K it always needs).</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Looking for trouble</font></b></p>

<p>If you want to find artifacts to help you pick settings, there
are a couple types of material which are especially problematic.
Strobe effects in music videos may cause fits. But the very worst
case is the ticker tape on CNBC (on US Cable), which goes by at
the right speed to fool the filter. Worse yet, it has bad (but
moving) dot crawl. You'll need to set the
<font color = "#993300">Recall</font> option pretty
high (about 85%) to avoid problems with it.</p>
