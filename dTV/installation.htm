<H2>Installation</H2>

<P>Put all the files into a directory and run dTV.exe.</P>

<h2>Getting It Working:</h2>

<P>On my setup I have got it working with PAL and NTSC.&nbsp; My card has a
BT878 and so it may work differently or not at all with your card.</P>

<P>I have not really tested the tuner part of the program, so first select the
external input</P>

<h3>PAL Setup</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Select video card type from list in Hardware/TV-Card</li>
  <li>Select tuner type from list in Hardware/Select Tuner</li>
  <li>In Hardware/PLL settings Box marked PLL (28MHz Crystal) should be ticked
    if you have anything except an B848 card, try with first</li>
  <li>Select required input from Settings/Video Input.</li>
  <li>Adjust Video settings using Setting/Video Adjustments</li>
</ol>

<h3>NTSC Setup</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Select video card type from list in Hardware/TV-Card</li>
  <li>Select tuner type from list in Hardware/Select Tuner</li>
  <li>Select NTSC from Settings/Video Format.</li>
  <li>Select required input from Settings/Video Input.</li>
  <li>Adjust Video settings using Setting/Video Adjustments</li>
</ol>

<h2>What if That Doesn't Work?</h2>
<p>Try the various PLL settings.<br>
