<h2>dTV.ini Settings</h2>

<p>Many features of the program are configurable through the menu system.&nbsp;
Some advanced settings and functions in beta test will require changes to this
ini file to work properly.&nbsp; All the settings used by the program are stored
here and no changes are made to the registry.</p>

<h3>[Pulldown]</h3>

<p><b>PulldownThresholdLow </b>Determines when PAL pulldown detection will
detect a noticable improvement in combing.&nbsp; Lower values (more negative)
will make detection require more combing to change.&nbsp; Change this if PAL
detection is not working for you.</p>

<p><b>PulldownThresholdHigh </b>Determines when PAL pulldown detection will go
back from movie mode to video mode.&nbsp; This value copes with certain types of
video noise, if it is set too low then it will flip back on static movie images,
if set too high it will remain in movie mode for too long.</p>

<p><b>PulldownRepeatCount </b>This is the number of times the pulldown pattern
must be detected before switching.</p>

<p><b>Threshold32Pulldown&nbsp;</b> This is the number of pixels per field that
need to be similar for NTSC movie detection to detect a triplet of fields from
the smae movie frame.&nbsp; Higher values will cope with more video noise but
will not detect the movies as well.</p>

<p><b>BitShift </b>This is used by the NTSC detection code to limit what
pixels are the same.&nbsp; This should allow for noise in source.&nbsp; The
value is applied to the square of the pixel difference with the results
bitshifted right by this amount.</p>

<p><b>DiffThreshold </b>.Not Used</p>

<p><b>PulldownRepeatCount2 </b>The number of times an unexpected pattern can
occur before switching back to video video mode from a film mode.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>[BTVPlugin]</h3>

<p><b>Name </b>Which bTV plug-in to load, the dll should be in the path or in
the dTV directory.</p>

<p><b>Level1 </b>Parameter passed to the plug-in</p>

<p><b>Level2 </b>Parameter passed to the plug-in</p>

<p><b>x</b> Parameter passed to the plug-in</p>

<p><b>y</b> Parameter passed to the plug-in</p>

<p><b>UseKey1</b> Parameter passed to the plug-in</p>

<p><b>UseKey2</b> Parameter passed to the plug-in</p>

<h3>[Deinterlace]</h3>

<p><b>EdgeDetect</b> This values governs the strength of edge detection, use
higher values if you think that the video deinterlacing is occurring too often.</p>

<p><b>JaggieThreshold</b> This values governs the threshold for fine line
dtection, use higher values if you get problems with small text</p>
