<h2>Getting It Working:</h2>

<P>On my setup I have got it working with PAL and NTSC.&nbsp; My card has a
BT878 and so it may work differently or not at all with your card.</P>

<h3>PAL Setup</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Delete any pervious copy of dTV.ini</li>
  <li>Select video card&nbsp; and tuner type from dialog box that appears on
    startup.&nbsp; If your exact card type is not listed then try Standard Card
    (bt878).&nbsp; The make of tuner should be on the silver box on the card,
    choose the correct type depending on your region.</li>
  <li>Select required input from Settings/Video Input.</li>
  <li>Adjust Video settings using Setting/Video Adjustments</li>
</ol>

<h3>NTSC Setup</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Delete any pervious copy of dTV.ini</li>
  <li>Select video card&nbsp; and tuner type from dialog box that appears on
    startup. If your exact card type is not listed then try Standard Card
    (bt878).&nbsp; The make of tuner should be on the silver box on the card,
    choose the correct type depending on your region.</li>
  <li>Select NTSC from Settings/Video Format.</li>
