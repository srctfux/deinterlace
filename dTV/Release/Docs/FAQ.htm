      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2>Where can I find the latest FAQ ?</h2>
      <p> <a href="http://deinterlace.sourceforge.net/FAQ.htm">Here at
      deinterlace.sourceforge.net/FAQ.htm&nbsp;</a>
      <h2>What is dScaler ?</h2>
      <p> dScaler is a piece of software that grabs analog, interlaced video, and 
        deinterlaces it to make it a progressive scan feed for use on your computer 
        monitor or projector and then allows scaling to any resolution.
      <p> Analog, interlaced video is what devices like VCRs, laserdisc, and
        game consoles output.
      <h2>What is so special about dScaler ?</h2>
      <p> Unlike most existing software for use with TV cards, dScaler implements 
        very sophisticated algorithms to deinterlace such sources. Using such 
        algorithms makes sure that each kind of video source is handled a different 
        way. It provides the user with a level of image quality unknown to PC owners
      until now. 
      <p> Some of those techniques are ;
      <ul>
        <li>video source deinterlacing</li>
        <li>inverse telecine detection: 2:2 (for pal movies) as well as 3:2 (for ntsc movies) pulldown</li>
        <li>Automatic aspect ratio control</li>
        <li>Judder elimination</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The image quality resulting from those complex operations is high and 
        allows some people equipped with data capable projectors to feed them 
        with progressive scan images.
      <h2>
      What is dTV?</h2>
      <p>dTV is the old name for dScaler, we changed the name as people use DTV
      to refer to digital television and this was causing confusion.&nbsp; In
      the source and on the website you will still see references to dTV but
      please refer to the program as dScaler from now on. 
      <h2>Who made what ?</h2>
      <p>See <a href="Authors.htm">dTV -- Authors</a> for the main contributors
      and <a href="Thanks.htm">dTV -- Thanks</a> for a list of people who have
      helped make dTV a success.</p>
      <h2>How much does dScaler cost ?</h2>
      <p> $1000 (plus taxes) :-) Of course not, dScaler is fully free of charge,
      open-source, 
        coded under GPL. 
      <h1>General issues</h1>
      <h2>Should I use dScaler to deinterlace the output from my set-top dvd player 
        ?</h2>
      <p> While it's feasible and works quite fine (see the "dTV Windvd challenge" 
        in the <a href="/screenshots.htm">screenshots</a> section), home theatre
      pc's have shown the best results while using dvd decoding software along 
        with a dvd-rom and a modern graphic card. However, it's been used quite 
        often for test purposes (testing of grab quality on a high quality source, 
        testing pulldown techniques on well encoded sources etc..). 
      <p> Some people have found that dScaler does a better job with non-film DVDs
        (concert videos or DVDs of some television shows, for example) than the
        software players. 
      <h1>Software issues</h1>
      <h2>Which operating system can I use dScaler on ?</h2>
      <p> Windows 95 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows 98 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows NT ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows Me ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows 2000 ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br>
        Linux no<br>
        OS/2 definitely no ;-) 
      <h2>What are all those deinterlace algorithms ?</h2>
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (Bob)</h3>
      <p> This method is based on Gunnar Thalin's VirtualDub filter.&nbsp; If it
      detects weaving artifacts in the current image it uses bob to get rid of
      them.&nbsp; This method has a tendency to bob rather too much and gives
      poor results on fine static images. 
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (Weave)</h3>
      <p> Similar to Video Deinterlace (Bob), however this method has a tendency
      to weave on moving images. 
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (2-Frame)</h3>
      <p>This method uses the current frame and the last two to determine
      whether to bob or weave a given pixel. This gives better results on
      both stationary and moving images than the above two methods however it
      uses more CPU. 
      <h3>Simple Weave</h3>
      <p> This method just combines the most recent even and odd fields.&nbsp;
      This causes motion artifacts and is provided for comparison. 
      <h3>Simple Bob</h3>
      <p>This uses only the most recent field and fills the lines in between
      with interpolated pixels.&nbsp; This method has in may ways been superceded
      by Scaler BOB. 
      <h3>Blended Clip</h3>
      <p> The BLENDED CLIP Deinterlace method is designed mostly for experimentation 
        by those interested in what works for video deinterlacing. When it is 
        selected it will pop up a control panel with many controls to adjust various 
        parameters. These all correspond to Blc... parameters in the [Deinterlace] 
        section of the dScaler.ini file and are documented there. It is probably not 
        the single best method for anything but it can be used to create custom 
        deinterlace methods for special purposes. These can be saved in a separate 
        ini file and invoked by a command line parameter when starting dScaler.exe. 
        Somewhat CPU intensive
      <h3> Scaler Bob</h3>
      <p> Uses the DirectDraw hardware bob feature (if available), this uses the
      current field and lets the video card scaler size the picture to fit the
      screen.&nbsp; Produces good results for fast moving images.
      <h3> Even Fields Only<br>
      Odd Fields Only</h3>
      <p>These use only one field out of each pair and use hardware
      scaling.&nbsp; This reduces bob artifacts at the cost of loss of
      information.&nbsp; These were originally intended to be used with game
      consoles.<h3>Adaptive Deinterlace</h3>
      <p>This method uses the amount of motion detected to select the best
      deinterlacing alogoritm.&nbsp; Currently by default it switches between
      2-Frame and weave. 
      <h3>Greedy deinterlace method</h3>
      <p> The GREEDY Deinterlace method is designed to give good results on low 
        motion video source, using less CPU than some others. Good on slower machines 
        but it will give awful results on high motion video material like sports. 
        Quite by accident, it can also do a decent job on poorly mastered 3:2 
        or 2:2 pull down film source material like some anime movies, regardless 
        of low or high motion. Try it if you have a movie source that is not giving 
        good results with normal Auto Pull Down processing.<h3>Greedy 2 Frame
      method</h3>
      <p>This method tries to combine the best features of the 2-frame algorithm
      with the looking ahead ability of the greedy method.&nbsp; I find this methods
      works well on sports and other high motion material.&nbsp; With static
      images and low quality sources there may be unacceptable levels of
      bobbing. 
      <h3>3:2 Pulldown, Skip Field X</h3>
      <p> Mostly on NTSC format, on a 24-fps film material, the material is encoded 
        as 48 fields (24 odd and 24 even). Each frame will be alternatingly played 
        3 and 2 times respectively. With regard to fields, the order played will 
        be come: Odd, Even, Odd (of frame 1) and Even, Odd (of Frame 2), and so 
        on. In order to create a pure progressive image (which is 1 frame of the 
        24-fps material), dScaler will only need to take the odd and even field, weaves 
        them together, skip the next odd frame and wait until the next odd and 
        even field arrives, weaves them together and put it out again. In the 
        field sequence, out of every 5 field, 1 field can be skipped. That field 
        that is skipped will be the number displayed on the pulldown Skip Field. 
        If all the sequences are coming in as perfect as described, and dScaler detects 
        it perfectly, the 3:2 pulldown method selected will always be set the 
        same. If the PC is rather slow (dropping fields), or the sequence is altered 
        (abruptly changing scenes), or dTV's tolerance in comparison is exceeded, 
        it will retry to lock again to the 3:2 pulldown, and might end up with 
        a different field to skip. 
      <h3>2:2 Pulldown</h3>
      <p> PAL movies are made of sequences of 2:2 frames. Once such a sequence 
        is detected, the Odd and Even fields are taken, weaved to form 1 frame 
        of the 24-fps material, and displayed. 
      <h2>Can I <i>remote control</i> dScaler ? <b>YES</b></h2>
      <p> Yes you can. dScaler is being developped mainly by people using it as an 
        analog source scaler for their projector and they prefer for sure using dScaler
      from their remote on the sofa rather than from their desk ;-)
      <p> dScaler is thus filled with <a href="keyboard.htm">keyboard shortcuts</a> 
        for all main options so that you can do everything quickly.<br>
        More, we suggest the use of <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~stilgar/windoze/girder.html">Girder</a> 
        from Ron Bessems as the application of choice for remote controlling your 
        computer.
      <p>
      <h2>Can I record video to my hard disk with dScaler?</h2>
      <p> No. dScaler isn't an all-in-one desktop video utility.  The development
        team has chosen to concentrate on making it the best video processor it can be,
        and features like recording would require a lot of time and effort
        we'd rather spend fine-tuning the deinterlacing algorithms or adding
        new convenience features for aspect ratio control.
      <p> If you want to record video, there are lots of alternatives to choose
        from, such as:
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="http://www.showshifter.com/">ShowShifter</a> for TiVo-like
          features such as an integrated program guide and pausing of live TV.
        <li> <a href="http://www.nct.ch/multimedia/avi_io">AVI_IO</a> is a
          video recording application that specializes in keeping audio locked to
          video even in the face of dropped frames.
        <li> <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/">VirtualDub</a>, an open-source
          desktop video application, can capture as well as edit and
          post-process
          video.
      </ul>
      <p> Of course, if you want to add video recording to dScaler, there's nothing
        stopping you!  That's what open source is all about. 
      <h1>Hardware issues</h1>
      <h2>Can I use any vga card as a display device ?</h2>
      <p> Despite this statement from Mark Rejhon ;
      <p> &quot;dScaler requires an AGP card. It is impossible to do on a PCI video card.
      dScaler uses massive amounts of *bidirectional* bus bandwidth: 250 megabits 
        per second incoming bandwidth (from TV card) and about 500 megabits per 
        second outgoing bandwidth (to videocard). This bus data firehose is not 
        feasible on PCI bus, as PCI can reliably continuously transfer up to about 
        600-700 megabits per second *in one direction only* out of a possible 
        1056 megabits per second (132 megabytes per second) due to overhead. Try 
        to go bidirectional, and framerate literally gets the death penalty!"
      <p> However, experience in the last monthes showed the some users were able 
        to use their PCI card with success and without dropped frames. In some 
        cases however, frame rate is going down when higher and higher resolutions 
        are tried ; 
      <p> IanD reported <i>I have an 8MB 3dfusion PCI on a BX mobo Celeron 566 
        64MB RAM 66MHz FSB, with Dynalink Magic TView (Conexant 878) and can only 
        execute dScaler at 16 bit colour depth. When running a 1024x768 desktop,
      dScaler v1.9 with a 720x576 @ 50Hz PAL composite input gives 0 DFS in manual Video 
        De-interlace mode for dScaler window sizes up to 848x629 (as determined from 
        dtv.ini) but 7+ DFS for window sizes even 1 pixel above either of these 
        dimensions</i>
      <p> Bottom line ; no specific requirement for dScaler. Probably works not so 
        bad on any vga card. However, as of today, GeForce based cards or (dualhead) 
        Matrox G4x0 are successfully used by a lot of users.
      <p> 
      <a name="BESTCARD"></a>
      <h2>Which capture card can I use ?</h2>
      <p> Almost any card (and that means A LOT) based of former Brooktree (now 
        Conexant) chips including bt848/878/879. Why those ? They are, for several 
        years now, the chipsets that are easy to program (there has been A LOT 
        of software based on those) and very cheap. Side effect ; a great number 
        of manufacturers have (and are still) produced cards based on those chipsets.
      <p> While we can't claim "this card is the one you need", let's give you 
        a couple ones that, at least, have been sucessfully used by some users 
        ;
      <ul>
        <li>Zoltrix Genie TV <a href="http://www.zoltix.com/products/GenieTVspecs.htm">http://www.zoltix.com/products/GenieTVspecs.htm</a> 
        <li>The WinTV series from Hauppage <a href="http://www.hauppage.com/html/products.htm">http://www.hauppage.com/html/products.htm</a> 
        <li>Guillemot maxi video 3 <a href="http://fr.guillemot.com/brand/gamme/video/mtvvidp3/mtvvidpci3.html">http://fr.guillemot.com/brand/gamme/video/mtvvidp3/mtvvidpci3.html</a>

      </ul>
      <p>Take a look at the <a href="/card_support.htm">card list</a>. This will 
      never be complete so feel free to drop us an email reporting your experience 
      with dScaler and your card.&nbsp; Also note that just because a card is on
      the list does not mean that it will work properly.&nbsp; Some features
      especially sound may not work correctly.</p>
      <p> <i>This list is originally based on the linux bttv driver on which the 
        program was originally based.</i>
      <h2>Can I use my existing <whatever> card's video input ?</h2>
      <p> Probably not. dScaler is supporting (see previous question) the Brooktree/Conexant 
        chipset. Supporting others chipsets, while feasable, means some hard work 
        and some solid knowledges of those chipsets. And <b>unfortunately, no 
        recent vga card with video-in feature includes Brooktree/Conexant chipset</b>. 
        Gx00, Asus Deluxe etc... are thus not supported at the moment. 
      <p> If you have some programming knowledge regarding the grab chipsets used 
        in those card, you might want to help us. See the "<a href="#HELP">How 
        can I help</a>" section.
      <h2>Can I use more than one video input ?</h2>
      <p> Some "nut" people (he's admitting it himself ;-) who are playing with 
        Picture In Picture a lot have asked if dScaler could drive multiple cards 
        or multiple inputs. A card allowing at worst 4 video inputs is manufactured 
        by Leadtek. It's the <a href="http://www.leadtek.com.tw/ewv605.htm">Winview 
        605</a>. 
      <p> It is Brooktree based so it might work with dScaler but clearly nothing 
        is done right now to drive multiple video inputs at the same time.
      <p> See the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004431.html">associated 
        topic</a> on AVS forum.
      <p> However, you can easily use your a/v receiver to switch between multiple 
        video inputs. Connect the monitor out of your equipement to your grab 
        card and all your video devices to video in connectors.

      <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
      <p> 
      <a name="PURPLESTRIPES"></a>
      <h2> 
      I have problems with sound?</h2>
      <p>Note that support for sound from cards internal tuners is not a
      priority for most of the developers of dTV.&nbsp; Almost all the
      developers use some kind of external TV tuner and bypass the sound
      issue.&nbsp; Having said that we will be pleased to accept fixes for any
      card but are not in a position to add support for new cards ourselves.
      <h2>What is this "purple stripes" issue ?</h2>
      <p> When feeding some analog sources to the combination grab card/dScaler, some 
        numerous horizontal colores lines appear on the image.
      <p> See <a href="/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOn.jpg">this picture</a> where 
        macrovision has been added to the video signal. The same video signal 
        <a href="/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOff.jpg">without the macrovision protection</a> 
        is perfectly stripes-free.
      <p> This phenomenom seems to be, at least, <b>more visible when a macrovision 
        protected video signal is fed</b> to some grab cards but this has been 
        reported also (despite less visible) on unprotected material.
      <p> Other examples of this phenomenon can be seen here ;<br>
        <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004317.html">avs:MacroVision

      <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004436.html">avs:dScaler 
        Purple Stripes - is this capture card dependent?</a>
      <p> Some infos from the <a href="http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html">Dvd 
        Faq</a> ;
      <p> <i>"Macrovision adds a rapidly modulated colorburst signal ("Colorstripe") 
        along with pulses in the vertical blanking signal ("AGC") to the composite 
        video and s-video outputs. This confuses the synchronization and automatic-recording-level 
        circuitry in 95% of consumer VCRs. Unfortunately, it can degrade the picture, 
        especially with old or nonstandard equipment. Macrovision may show up 
        as stripes of color, distortion, rolling, black & white picture, and dark/light 
        cycling. Macrovision creates problems for many line doublers."</i>
      <p> <b>WARNING</b> This has been reported only when feeding, for test purposes, 
        a dvd player to the computer. Problems on other type of sources have yet 
        to be shown.
      <p>So in common cases, you don't have to worry about this.
      <h2>Despite having a very powerful system, I still get some dropped frames?</h2>
      <p>Some people experienced some dropped frames (signs of a machine that has 
      problems keeping up with the workload of dScaler) even on powerful systems. 
      An hypothesis is that some motherboard agp speed issue might be the cause 
      of such behavior.</p>
      <p> JackB reported <i>We looked at his BIOS settings and the only major 
        difference is that his had a 4X AGP mode and my MB only has a 2X AGP mode 
        <snip>We put my video card, a GeForce2 MX, in his(slower supposedly)system 
        and it ran 0 DFS. So it's not the MX throughput that's the problem. So, 
        I'm down to it's my motherboard not being up to speed in either AGP acceleration 
        or I have some settings set incorrectly</i>
      <p> 
      <a name="OVERLAY"></a>
      <h2>I get "overlay update" errors</h2>
      <p> Sometimes you get this error message <br>
        <code>Error calling overlay update. D:/source/deinterlace/dtv/other.c 
        at line 161</code><br>
        We don't have any full explanation of the problem but it happens when 
        resizing dScaler or making it go from fullscreen to window mode. Also the 
        color depth, frequency and size of the desktop might be related. The problem 
        seems to have disappeared with dScaler starting from version 2.0.0

      <p>Please report bugs on the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi">AV
      Science Forum</a> after checking (using the search feature) that the
      problem has not already been reported. Each bug report should include the
      hardware you're using, especially video card, grab card and processor type
      and speed.</p>
      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p> Any help is welcome. Despite including very complex code, there are a 
        lot of features in it that are simple or that could be easily implemented 
        without knowing anything about 3:2 pulldown detection.<p> If you've got an idea, or feel like to trying to implement something 
        that is already in the <a href="/Todo.htm">Todo list</a>, join the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=7420">mailing 
        list</a>. All relevant information to get you started are on the <a href="/developers.htm">developers 
        page</a>.
