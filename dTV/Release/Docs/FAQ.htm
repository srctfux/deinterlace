      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2>Where can I find the latest FAQ ?</h2>
      <p> <a href="http://deinterlace.sourceforge.net/FAQ.htm">Here at
      deinterlace.sourceforge.net/FAQ.htm&nbsp;</a>
      <h2>What is dTV ?</h2>
      <p> dTV is a piece of software that grabs analog, interlaced video, and 
        deinterlaces it to make it a progressive scan feed for use on your computer 
        monitor or projector.
      <p> Analog, interlaced video is what output devices like vcr, laserdisc, 
        game consoles ... 
      <p>
      <h2>What is so special about dTV ?</h2>
      <p> Unlike most existing software that tries to do the same, dTV implements 
        very sophisticated algorithms to deinterlace such sources. Using such 
        algorithms makes sure that each kind of video source is handled a different 
        way. It provides the user with a level of image quality unknown to pc 
        owners up to now. 
      <p> Some of those techniques are ;
      <ul>
        <li>video source deinterlacing</li>
        <li>inverse telecine detection</li>
        <li>2:2 (for pal movies) as well as 3:2 (for ntsc movies) pulldown</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The image quality resulting from those complex operations is high and 
        allows some people equipped with data capable projectors to feed them 
        with a progressive scan source that was interlaced right before.
      <p> 
      <h2>Who made what ?</h2>
      <p> 
      <h3>Developers</h3>
      <p> 
      <h3><i>John Adcock</i></h3>
      <p>John is the founder of the project. He did huge amounts of full time 
        development over a three-month period during a lucky work break on versions 
        1.0 through 1.06 Beta 4. He did most of the work cleaning, translating 
        and legalizing Multidec. He put into code, the world's first open-source 
        real-time 3:2 pulldown software deinterlacer (based on Mark Rejhon's algorithm 
        article). He also designed an open-source video-material deinterlacer 
        that is superior to those in virtually any other any PC-based video software 
        product.</p>
      <h3><br>
        <i> Mark Rejhon</i></h3>
      <p>As of version 1.07, Mark is the project admin. He is also the moderator 
        of the Internet's largest Home Theater Computers forum at <a href="../../../htdocs/www.avsforum.com">AVSFORUM</a>. 
        Mark authored the 3:2 pulldown algorithm that forms the basis of the algorithm 
        implemented into dTV by JohnAd. He also does other programming tasks like 
        code cleanup, merging, documenting, testing, enhancing of contributors' 
        changes that are submitted to the project. He also enhances dTV with his 
        own changes to certain parts of the code, including improvements to the 
        deinterlacer modes.</p>
      <h3><br>
        <i> Steve Grimm</i></h3>
      <p>Steve is contributing enhancements to the deinterlacing modes including 
        better automatic switching between video mode and 3:2 pulldown mode, and 
        handling of material that has bad 3:2 pulldown. He also worked on an early 
        version of a 3:2 pulldown deinterlacing algorithm.</p>
      <h3><br>
        <i> Michael Samblanet</i></h3>
      <p>Michael is continuing to upgrade his aspect ratio control code.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h3><i>Tom Barry</i></h3>
      <p> Tom contributed the triple buffering code and synchronization fixes 
        for version 2.0.0. Also, he has authored several MMX assembly optimizations 
        to the video deinterlace mode and added the advanced Brooktree/Conexant 
        chipset settings menu, both of which were included in version 1.9. <br>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h3><i>Michael Eskin</i></h3>
      <p> Michael works for Conexant and brings his technical expertise of the 
        capture chipset to the dTV project. He's also contributing to various 
        parts of the code among which, the OSD code. <br>

      <h2>How much does dTV cost ?</h2>
      <p> $1000 (plus taxes) :-) Of course not, dTV is fully free of charge, freeware, 
        coded under GPL. 
      <p> 
      <h1>General issues</h1>
      <p> 
      <p>
      <h2>Should I use dTV to deinterlace the output from my set-top dvd player 
        ?</h2>
      <p> While it's feasable and works quite fine (see the "dTV Windvd challenge" 
        in the <a href="/screenshots.htm">screenshots</a> section), home theater 
        pc's have shown the best results while using dvd decoding software along 
        with a dvd-rom and a modern graphic card. However, it's been used quite 
        often for test purposes (testing of grab quality on a high quality source, 
        testing pulldown techniques on well encoded sources etc..). 
      <p> 
      <h1>Software issues</h1>
      <p> 
      <h2>Which operating system can I use dTV on ?</h2>
      <p> Windows 95 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows 98 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows NT ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows Me ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows 2000 ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br>
        Linux no<br>
        OS/2 definitely no ;-) 
      <h2>What are all those deinterlace algorithms ?</h2>
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (Bob)</h3>
      <p> This method is based on Gunnar Thalin's VirtualDub filter.&nbsp; If it
      detects weaving artifacts in the current image it uses bob to get rid of
      them.&nbsp; This method has a tendency to bob rather too much and gives
      poor results on fine static images. 
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (Weave)</h3>
      <p> Similar to Video Deinterlace (Bob), however this method has a tendency
      to weave on moving images. 
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (2-Frame)</h3>
      <p>This method uses the current frame and the last two to determine
      whether to bob or weave a given pixel.&nbsp; This gives better results on
      both stationary and moving images than the above two methods however it
      uses more CPU. 
      <h3>Simple Weave</h3>
      <p> This method just combines the most recent even and odd fields.&nbsp;
      This causes motion artifacts and is provided for comparison. 
      <h3>Simple Bob</h3>
      <p>This uses only the most recent field and fills the lines in between
      with interpolated pixels.&nbsp; This method has in may ways been superceded
      by Scaler BOB. 
      <h3>Blended Clip</h3>
      <p> The BLENDED CLIP Deinterlace method is designed mostly for experimentation 
        by those interested in what works for video deinterlacing. When it is 
        selected it will pop up a control panel with many controls to adjust various 
        parameters. These all correspond to Blc... parameters in the [Deinterlace] 
        section of the dTV.ini file and are documented there. It is probably not 
        the single best method for anything but it can be used to create custom 
        deinterlace methods for special purposes. These can be saved in a separate 
        ini file and invoked by a command line parameter when starting dTV.exe. 
        Somewhat CPU intensive
      <h3> Scaler Bob</h3>
      <p> Uses the DirectDraw hardware bob feature (if available), this uses the
      current field and lets the video card scaler size the picture to fit the
      screen.&nbsp; Produces good results for fast moving images.
      <h3> Even Fields Only<br>
      Odd Fields Only</h3>
      <p>These use only one field out of each pair and use hardware
      scaling.&nbsp; This reduces bob artifacts at the cost of loss of
      information.&nbsp; These were originally intended to be used with game
      consoles.<h3>Adaptive Deinterlace</h3>
      <p>This method uses the amount of motion detected to select the best
      deinterlacing alogoritm.&nbsp; Currently by default it switches between
      2-Frame and weave. 
      <h3>Greedy deinterlace method</h3>
      <p> The GREEDY Deinterlace method is designed to give good results on low 
        motion video source, using less CPU than some others. Good on slower machines 
        but it will give awful results on high motion video material like sports. 
        Quite by accident, it can also do a decent job on poorly mastered 3:2 
        or 2:2 pull down film source material like some anime movies, regardless 
        of low or high motion. Try it if you have a movie source that is not giving 
        good results with normal Auto Pull Down processing. 
      <h3>BTV Plugin</h3>
      <p> <i>Deprecated. Included initially to allow usage of video plugins that 
        could have been made for BorgTV (see <a href="#THANKS">thanks</a>)</i>
      <p> Uses borgTV's plugin for deinterlacing purposes. Most people deem dTV's 
        deinterlacing solution is better than borgTV's. YMMV. 
      <h3>3:2 Pulldown, Skip Field X</h3>
      <p> Mostly on NTSC format, on a 24-fps film material, the material is encoded 
        as 48 fields (24 odd and 24 even). Each frame will be alternatingly played 
        3 and 2 times respectively. With regard to fields, the order played will 
        be come: Odd, Even, Odd (of frame 1) and Even, Odd (of Frame 2), and so 
        on. In order to create a pure progressive image (which is 1 frame of the 
        24-fps material), dTV will only need to take the odd and even field, weaves 
        them together, skip the next odd frame and wait until the next odd and 
        even field arrives, weaves them together and put it out again. In the 
        field sequence, out of every 5 field, 1 field can be skipped. That field 
        that is skipped will be the number displayed on the pulldown Skip Field. 
        If all the sequences are coming in as perfect as described, and dTV detects 
        it perfectly, the 3:2 pulldown method selected will always be set the 
        same. If the PC is rather slow (dropping fields), or the sequence is altered 
        (abruptly changing scenes), or dTV's tolerance in comparison is exceeded, 
        it will retry to lock again to the 3:2 pulldown, and might end up with 
        a different field to skip. 
      <h3>2:2 Pulldown</h3>
      <p> PAL movies are made of sequences of 2:2 frames. Once such a sequence 
        is detected, the Odd and Even fields are taken, weaved to form 1 frame 
        of the 24-fps material, and displayed. 
      <h2>When taking a snapshot, dTV outputs ppm files, what are those ?</h2>
      <i>Deprecated ; Since version 2, dTV outputs more widely used TIFF files 
      that are supported by many applications out there</i> 
      <p> It's called Portable PixMap. Actually, this is the only graphic file 
        code that John Adcock had when writing dTV ;-)<br>
        It's perfectly handled by several applications including 
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p> 
      <h2>Can I <i>remote control</i> dTV ? <b>YES</b></h2>
      <p> Yes you can. dTV is being developped mainly by people using it as an 
        analog source scaler for their projector and they prefer for sure using 
        dTV from their remote on the sofa rather than from their desk ;-)
      <p> dTV is thus filled with <a href="/keyboard.htm">keyboard shortcuts</a> 
        for all main options so that you can do everything quickly.<br>
        More, we suggest the use of <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~stilgar/windoze/girder.html">Girder</a> 
        from Ron Bessems as the application of choice for remote controling your 
        computer.

      <p> 
      <h1>Hardware issues</h1>
      <p> 
      <h2>Can I use any vga card as a display device ?</h2>
      <p> Despite this statement from Mark Rejhon ;
      <p> "dTV requires an AGP card. It is impossible to do on a PCI video card. 
        dTV uses massive amounts of *bidirectional* bus bandwidth: 250 megabits 
        per second incoming bandwidth (from TV card) and about 500 megabits per 
        second outgoing bandwidth (to videocard). This bus data firehose is not 
        feasible on PCI bus, as PCI can reliably continuously transfer up to about 
        600-700 megabits per second *in one direction only* out of a possible 
        1056 megabits per second (132 megabytes per second) due to overhead. Try 
        to go bidirectional, and framerate literally gets the death penalty!"
      <p> However, experience in the last monthes showed the some users were able 
        to use their PCI card with success and without dropped frames. In some 
        cases however, frame rate is going down when higher and higher resolutions 
        are tried ; 
      <p> IanD reported <i>I have an 8MB 3dfusion PCI on a BX mobo Celeron 566 
        64MB RAM 66MHz FSB, with Dynalink Magic TView (Conexant 878) and can only 
        execute dTV at 16 bit colour depth. When running a 1024x768 desktop, dTV 
        v1.9 with a 720x576 @ 50Hz PAL composite input gives 0 DFS in manual Video 
        De-interlace mode for dTV window sizes up to 848x629 (as determined from 
        dtv.ini) but 7+ DFS for window sizes even 1 pixel above either of these 
        dimensions</i>
      <p> Bottom line ; no specific requirement for dTV. Probably works not so 
        bad on any vga card. However, as of today, GeForce based cards or (dualhead) 
        Matrox G4x0 are successfully used by a lot of users.
      <p> 
      <a name="BESTCARD"></a>
      <h2>Which capture card can I use ?</h2>
      <p> Almost any card (and that means A LOT) based of former Brooktree (now 
        Conexant) chips including bt848/878/879. Why those ? They are, for several 
        years now, the chipsets that are easy to program (there has been A LOT 
        of software based on those) and very cheap. Side effect ; a great number 
        of manufacturers have (and are still) produced cards based on those chipsets.
      <p> While we can't claim "this card is the one you need", let's give you 
        a couple ones that, at least, have been sucessfully used by some users 
        ;

      <p>Take a look at the <a href="/card_support.htm">card list</a>. This will 
      never be complete so feel free to drop us an email reporting your experience 
      with dTV and your card.</p>
      <p> <i>This list is originally based on the linux bttv driver on which the 
        program was originally based.</i>
      <p> 
      <h2>Can I use my existing <whatever> card's video input ?</h2>
      <p> Probably not. dTV is supporting (see previous question) the Brooktree/Conexant 
        chipset. Supporting others chipsets, while feasable, means some hard work 
        and some solid knowledges of those chipsets. And <b>unfortunately, no 
        recent vga card with video-in feature includes Brooktree/Conexant chipset</b>. 
        Gx00, Asus Deluxe etc... are thus not supported at the moment. 
      <p> If you have some programming knowledge regarding the grab chipsets used 
        in those card, you might want to help us. See the "<a href="#HELP">How 
        can I help</a>" section.
      <p> 
      <h2>Can I use more than one video input ?</h2>
      <p> Some "nut" people (he's admitting it himself ;-) who are playing with 
        Picture In Picture a lot have asked if dTV could drive multiple cards 
        or multiple inputs. A card allowing at worst 4 video inputs is manufactured 
        by Leadtek. It's the <a href="http://www.leadtek.com.tw/ewv605.htm">Winview 
        605</a>. 
      <p> It is Brooktree based so it might work with dTV but clearly nothing 
        is done right now to drive multiple video inputs at the same time.
      <p> See the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004431.html">associated 
        topic</a> on AVS forum.
      <p> However, you can easily use your a/v receiver to switch between multiple 
        video inputs. Connect the monitor out of your equipement to your grab 
        card and all your video devices to video in connectors.

      <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
      <p> 
      <a name="PURPLESTRIPES"></a>
      <h2>What is this "purple stripes" issue ?</h2>
      <p> When feeding some analog sources to the combination grab card/dTV, some 
        numerous horizontal colores lines appear on the image.
      <p> See <a href="/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOn.jpg">this picture</a> where 
        macrovision has been added to the video signal. The same video signal 
        <a href="/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOff.jpg">without the macrovision protection</a> 
        is perfectly stripes-free.
      <p> This phenomenom seems to be, at least, <b>more visible when a macrovision 
        protected video signal is fed</b> to some grab cards but this has been 
        reported also (despite less visible) on unprotected material.

        Purple Stripes - is this capture card dependent?</a>
      <p> Some infos from the <a href="http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html">Dvd 
        Faq</a> ;
      <p> <i>"Macrovision adds a rapidly modulated colorburst signal ("Colorstripe") 
        along with pulses in the vertical blanking signal ("AGC") to the composite 
        video and s-video outputs. This confuses the synchronization and automatic-recording-level 
        circuitry in 95% of consumer VCRs. Unfortunately, it can degrade the picture, 
        especially with old or nonstandard equipment. Macrovision may show up 
        as stripes of color, distortion, rolling, black & white picture, and dark/light 
        cycling. Macrovision creates problems for many line doublers."</i>
      <p> <b>WARNING</b> This has been reported only when feeding, for test purposes, 
        a dvd player to the computer. Problems on other type of sources have yet 
        to be shown.
      <p>So in common cases, you don't have to worry about this.

      <h2>Despite a very powerful system, I've still got some dropped frames ?</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Some people experienced some dropped frames (signs of a machine that has 
      problems keeping up with the workload of dTV) even on powerful systems. 
      An hypothesis is that some motherboard agp speed issue might be the cause 
      of such behavior.</p>
      <p> JackB reported <i>We looked at his BIOS settings and the only major 
        difference is that his had a 4X AGP mode and my MB only has a 2X AGP mode 
        <snip>We put my video card, a GeForce2 MX, in his(slower supposedly)system 
        and it ran 0 DFS. So it's not the MX throughput that's the problem. So, 
        I'm down to it's my motherboard not being up to speed in either AGP acceleration 
        or I have some settings set incorrectly</i>

      <h2>I get "overlay update" errors</h2>
      <p> Sometimes you get this error message <br>
        <code>Error calling overlay update. D:/source/deinterlace/dtv/other.c 
        at line 161</code><br>
        We don't have any full explanation of the problem but it happens when 
        resizing dTV or making it go from fullscreen to window mode. Also the 
        color depth, frequency and size of the desktop might be related. The problem 
        seems to have disappeared with dTV starting from version 2.0.0

      <h1>How can I help ?</h1>
      <p> 
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p> More and more people are giving dTV a try. Why wouldn't you ? We'd like 
        to know about your experience with it. What does (not) work ? What can 
        be improved, what feature you'd like. Every feedback is useful. 
      <p> Please have a look, when reporting a problem, to the <a href="/Bugs.htm">bug 
        list</a>. Report also the hardware you're using, especially video card 
        and grab card. 
      <p> 
      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p> Any help is welcome. Despite including very complex code, there's a 
        lot of features in it that are simple or that could be easily implemented 
        without knowing anything about 3:2 pulldown detection.
      <p> If you've got an idea, or feel like to trying to implement something 
        that is already in the <a href="/Todo.htm">Todo list</a>, contact the 
        authors and join the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=7420">mailing 
        list</a>. All relevant infos to get you started are on the <a href="/developers.htm">developers
