<H2>Requirements:</H2>

<P>I think it will run on Win 95/98 and NT.  I have tested it on 98, Windows
2000.</P>

<P>You will need a processor faster than about Pentium II 400MHz.</P>

<P>You will definitely need a PCI TV card with a BT848 BT849 BT878 BT879 in it.</P>

<P>This software will not work with ATI All-in-Wonder or Matrox TV cards.</P>

<h1><font color="#FF0000">Warning</font></h1>

<P><font color="#FF0000">This program installs a temporary driver while it
runs.&nbsp; This means that some of the code runs inside Ring0 along with the
kernel.&nbsp; What this means is that if anything goes wrong this program can
crash your whole system causing a BSOD in NT or a hanging 95/98.&nbsp; I have
had no problems running the exe stand alone but you may get problems.&nbsp; If
using a debugger then it it is very important that the program is allowed to
shut down normally.&nbsp; If you use Stop Debugging while running the program
you system WILL crash.</font></P>

<P><font color="#FF0000">As a precaution sync the disks before running this
program.&nbsp; Use the sync utility from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">http://www.sysinternals.com/</a>
for whichever operating system you are running.</font></P>

<H2>What does it do?</H2>

<P>At the moment it allows you to trawl thought the available pull down modes
manually using the space bar.&nbsp; So to use get a picture by playing around
with the settings as above.&nbsp; Then put in a film and press the spacebar
until the weave patterns disappear.</P>

<p>It is possible to specify a bTV plugin for the program to use.&nbsp; The
default is bDeinterlace.dll with UseKey1 set to 1.</p>
