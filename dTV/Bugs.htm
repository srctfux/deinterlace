<h1>dTV Bugs</h1>
dTV is still in the early stages of development.&nbsp; It will probably never be
truly stable and shrink-warp quality.&nbsp; That being said the developers are
keen to have the software running as well as possible.&nbsp; This file is
intended to used as a place to keep track of the current known bugs so that
people who want to join the project have a good place to start looking for
problems to fix.<br>
<ol>
  <li>VBI code sometimes cases video to jump about.&nbsp; (cause could be
    constant DMA overruns)</li>
  <li>After either pauses, format&nbsp;changes or maximizing the software will
    no longer lock onto correct pulldown mode and run with bad artifacts.&nbsp;
    BT Reset does no cure this but software behaves well after it is started and
    stopped (Agian appears to be DMA related, or possible bug in the output code
    causing the flip frames to get out of sync)</li>
  <li>Does not work on Mpact video cards in 24 bit hacked mode (not sure if this
    is possible to fix although DVD software run on these cards)</li>
  <li>Playback is jumpy.&nbsp; This is because there is no code to try and synchronize
    the TV data to the PV Video card refresh rate.&nbsp; On slower machines this
    should be less of a problem but at higher speeds the TV frames will not be
    displayed smoothly.</li>
  <li>Tearing appears.&nbsp; May be linked to some of the above bugs, in
    particular number 2.</li>
  <li>The tuner operation of the software is extremely buggy. Improvement in
    this area are most welcome.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to add your own!</p>
