      <p>Many features of the program are configurable through the menu
      system.&nbsp; Some advanced settings and functions in beta test will
      require changes to this ini file to work properly.&nbsp; All the settings
      used by the program are stored here and no changes are made to the
      registry.</p>

      <p>While the default name of this file is DScaler.ini, other names and
      copies may be used, to create multiple profiles.&nbsp; Just create a
      shortcut to invoke DScaler with a single parameter such as "DScaler.exe
      vcr.ini".&nbsp; This would cause the vcr.ini (or whatever) file to be
      used and saved on exit.&nbsp; Doing this is easiest if you copy a working
      DScaler.ini file first and then change it using the DScaler menus.</p>

          <td>Scaler Bob</td>

          <td>Like Simple Bob, but uses the display hardware to expand the
          half-resolution image rather than doing it in software. Uses less CPU
          time than Simple Bob and looks better on some video cards. Switching
          to and from this mode may produce brief distortions in the
          picture.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>6-7</td>

          <td>2:2 Pulldown</td>

          <td>PAL film modes, each film frame corresponding to two video fields
          for a frame rate of 25FPS. Generally you will want to let DScaler
          automatically detect these modes rather than setting them by
          hand.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>8-12</td>

          <td>3:2 Pulldown</td>

          <td>NTSC film modes, each pair of film frames corresponding to five
          video fields for a frame rate of 24FPS. Generally you will want to
          let DScaler automatically detect these modes rather than setting them
          by hand.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>13-14</td>

          <td>Even/Odd Only</td>

          <td>Ignore the odd or even fields, respectively. Essentially these
          are bob modes, but they may produce better results on some video
          cards than simple bobbing. Mostly useful for older videogame systems
          (PlayStation, Nintendo64, etc.) that render games at half
          resolution.</td>

        <tr>

          <td>Blended Clip</td>

          <td>Attempts to smoothly blend the results of weaving and bobbing
          rather than simply choosing one or the other outright. This mode has
          a lot of settings that can be tweaked with a control panel.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>16</td>

          <td>Adaptive</td>

          <td>Not exactly a mode in its own right, the adaptive algorithm
          switches between other deinterlace modes depending on the amount of
          motion in the scene. Its exact behavior is controlled by
          LowMotionFieldCount, HighMotionMode, and related INI file settings;
          see the [Pulldown] section above.</td>

          <td>Greedy</td>

          <td>Examines several nearby pixels to determine which one will
          produce the best image. Works well on poorly-mastered film material
          and on video with low amounts of motion.</td>

          <td>Greedy 2 Frame</td>

          Works well on sports and on video with large amounts of motion.</td>
