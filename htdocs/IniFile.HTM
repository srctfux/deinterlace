      <p>Many features of the program are configurable through the menu system.&nbsp; 
        Some advanced settings and functions in beta test will require changes 
        to this ini file to work properly.&nbsp; All the settings used by the 
        program are stored here and no changes are made to the registry.</p>
      <p>While the default name of this file is dTV.ini, other names and copies
      may be used, to create multiple profiles.&nbsp; Just create a shortcut to
      invoke dTV with a single parameter such as &quot;dTV.exe vcr.ini&quot;.&nbsp;
      This would cause the vcr.ini (or whatever) file to be used and saved on
      exit.&nbsp; Doing this is easiest if you copy a working dTV.ini file first
      and then change it using the dTV menus.</p>
