      <p>Last update ; January, the 24st, 2001</p>
      <p> 
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> 
      <h2>What is dTV ?</h2>
      <p> dTV is a piece of software that grabs analog, interlaced video, and 
        deinterlace it to make it a progressive scan feed for use on your computer 
        monitor or projector.
      <p> Analog, interlaced video is what output devices like vcr, laserdisc, 
        game consoles ... 
      <p>
      <h2>What is so special about dTV ?</h2>
      <p> Unlike most existing software that tries to do the same, dTV implements 
        very sophisticated algorithms to deinterlace such sources. Using such 
        algorithms makes sure that each kind of video source is handled a different 
        way. <br>
        It provides the user with a level of image quality unknown to pc owners 
        up to now.
      <p> Some of those techniques are ;
      <ul>
        <li>video source deinterlacing</li>
        <li>inverse telecine detection</li>
        <li>2:2 (for pal movies) as well as 3:2 (for ntsc movies) pulldown</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The image quality resulting from those complex operations is high and 
        allows some people equipped with data capable projectors to feed them 
        with a progressive scan source that was interlaced right before.
      <p> 
      <h2>Who made what ?</h2>
      <p> See <a href="Authors.htm">DScaler - Authors</a> for the main contributors 
        and <a href="Thanks.htm">DScaler - Thanks</a> for a list of people who have 
        helped make dTV a success. 
      <h2>How much does dTV cost ?</h2>
      <p> 1000$ (plus taxes) :-) Of course not, dTV is fully free of charge, freeware, 
        coded under GPL.
      <p> 
      <h1>General issues</h1>
      <p> 
      <p>
      <h2>Should I use dTV to deinterlace the output from my set-top dvd player 
        ?</h2>
      <p> While it's feasable and works quite fine (see the "dTV Windvd challenge" 
        in the <a href="/screenshots.htm">screenshots</a> section), home theater 
        pc's have shown the best results while using dvd decoding software along 
        with a dvd-rom and a modern graphic card.<br>
        However, it's been used quite often for test purposes (testing of grab 
        quality on a high quality source, testing pulldown techniques on well 
        encoded sources etc..).
      <p> 
      <h1>Software issues</h1>
      <p> 
      <h2>Which operating system can I use dTV on ?</h2>
      <p> Windows 95 ok<br>
        Windows 98 ok<br>
        Windows NT ok <i>requires that a VxD runs in ring-0 (nt ultra low level 
        part of the os</i><br>
        Windows Me ok <i>tested with an Hauppage 401 without problem</i><br>
        Windows 2000 ok<br>
        Linux no<br>
        OS/2 definitely no ;-) 
      <p> 
      <h2>What are all those deinterlace algorithms ?</h2>
      <p><br>
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (Bob)</h3>
      <p> This method is just a simple bob method used when dTV determines that 
        the changes between the odd and even fields are extreme. This method will 
        result in jitter (on static parts of the image) and jagged edges on diagonal 
        lines. 
      <h3>Simple Weave</h3>
      <p> This method will weave the even and odd field if dTV determines that 
        the changes between them are not severe. Setting dTV to always use this 
        method will result in video playback that is almost identical to viewing 
        on interlaced displays. 
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (Weave)</h3>
      <p> Similar to the above Simple Weave, with an enhancement. The method is 
        enhanced by modifying the pixels that dTV determines is different enough 
        than the pixel above and below it. 
      <h3>Interpolated Bob</h3>
      <p> As far as I can read the code, I don't see this method being used at 
        all. If any developers can rectify this, please do. 
      <h3>Blended Clip</h3>
      <p> The BLENDED CLIP DeInterlace method is designed mostly for experimentation 
        by those interested in what works for video deinterlacing. When it is 
        selected it will pop up a control panel with many controls to adjust various 
        parameters. These all correspond to Blc... parameters in the [Deinterlace] 
        section of the dTV.ini file and are documented there. It is probably not 
        the single best method for anything but it can be used to create custom 
        deinterlace methods for special purposes. These can be saved in a separate 
        ini file and invoked by a command line parameter when starting dTV.exe. 
        Somewhat CPU intensive
      <p> 
      <h3>Greedy deinterlace method</h3>
      <p> The GREEDY DeInterlace method is designed to give good results on low 
        motion video source, using less CPU than some others. Good on slower machines 
        but it will give awful results on high motion video material like sports. 
        Quite by accident, it can also do a decent job on poorly mastered 3:2 
        or 2:2 pull down film source material like some anime movies, regardless 
        of low or high motion. Try it if you have a movie source that is not giving 
        good results with normal Auto Pull Down processing.
      <p> 
      <h3>BTV Plugin</h3>
      <p> <i>Deprecated. Included initially to allow usage of video plugins that 
        could have been made for BorgTV (see <a href="#THANKS">thanks</a>)</i>
      <p> Uses borgTV's plugin for deinterlacing purposes. Most people deem dTV's 
        deinterlacing solution is better than borgTV's. YMMV. 
      <h3>3:2 Pulldown, Skip Field X</h3>
      <p> Mostly on NTSC format, on a 24-fps film material, the material is encoded 
        as 48 fields (24 odd and 24 even). Each frame will be alternatingly played 
        3 and 2 times respectively. With regard to fields, the order played will 
        be come: Odd, Even, Odd (of frame 1) and Even, Odd (of Frame 2), and so 
        on. In order to create a pure progressive image (which is 1 frame of the 
        24-fps material), dTV will only need to take the odd and even field, weaves 
        them together, skip the next odd frame and wait until the next odd and 
        even field arrives, weaves them together and put it out again. In the 
        field sequence, out of every 5 field, 1 field can be skipped. That field 
        that is skipped will be the number displayed on the pulldown Skip Field. 
        If all the sequences are coming in as perfect as described, and dTV detects 
        it perfectly, the 3:2 pulldown method selected will always be set the 
        same. If the PC is rather slow (dropping fields), or the sequence is altered 
        (abruptly changing scenes), or dTV's tolerance in comparison is exceeded, 
        it will retry to lock again to the 3:2 pulldown, and might end up with 
        a different field to skip. 
      <h3>2:2 Pulldown</h3>
      <p> PAL movies are made of sequences of 2:2 frames. Once such a sequence 
        is detected, the Odd and Even fields are taken, weaved to form 1 frame 
        of the 24-fps material, and displayed. 
      <h2>When taking a snapshot, old versions of dTV outputs ppm files, what 
        are those ?</h2>
      <p> It's called Portable PixMap. Actually, this is the only graphic file 
        code that John Adcock had when writing dTV ;-)<br>
        It's perfectly handled by several applications including 
      <ul>
        <li>ACDSee 3 <a href="http://www.acdsystems.com/english/products/acdsee/index.htm">http://www.acdsystems.com/english/products/acdsee/index.htm</a> 
        <li>Irfanview <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/english.htm">http://www.irfanview.com/english.htm</a> 
        <li>Paint Shop Pro <a href="http://www.jasc.com/product.asp?pf%5Fid=001">http://www.jasc.com/product.asp?pf%5Fid=001</a> 
      </ul>
      <p> 
      <h2> My picture jumps up and down?<br>
        I get dropped frames?</h2>
      <p> Both problems seems to be caused by not having a powerful enough machine 
        to run everything all at the same time.&nbsp; The things that use up a 
        lot of CPU time are 2-Frame and Blended Clip deinterlacing and automatic 
        pulldown detection.&nbsp; Try moving to another pulldown method or switching 
        off autodetection.&nbsp; The other alternative is to buy a faster PC ;-))</p>
      <p> There is now a setting in Select Hardware which allows you to tell dTV 
        how fast your PC is.&nbsp; Try selecting alower speed if you get either 
        of these problems.</p>
      <h2>Can I <i>remote control</i> dTV ? <b>YES</b></h2>
      <p> Yes you can. dTV is being developped mainly by people using it as an 
        analog source scaler for their projector and they prefer for sure using 
        dTV from their remote on the sofa rather than from their desk ;-)
      <p> dTV is thus filled with <a href="/keyboard.htm">keyboard shortcuts</a> 
        for all main options so that you can do everything quickly.<br>
        More, we suggest the use of <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~stilgar/windoze/girder.html">Girder</a> 
        from Ron Bessems as the application of choice for remote controling your 
        computer.
      <p> 
      <p> 
      <h1>Hardware issues</h1>
      <p> 
      <h2>Can I use any vga card as a display device ?</h2>
      <p> Despite this statement from Mark Rejhon ;
      <p> "dTV requires an AGP card. It is impossible to do on a PCI video card. 
        dTV uses massive amounts of *bidirectional* bus bandwidth: 250 megabits 
        per second incoming bandwidth (from TV card) and about 500 megabits per 
        second outgoing bandwidth (to videocard). This bus data firehose is not 
        feasible on PCI bus, as PCI can reliably continuously transfer up to about 
        600-700 megabits per second *in one direction only* out of a possible 
        1056 megabits per second (132 megabytes per second) due to overhead. Try 
        to go bidirectional, and framerate literally gets the death penalty!"
      <p> However, experience in the last monthes showed the some users were able 
        to use their PCI card with success and without dropped frames.<br>
        In some cases however, frame rate is going down when higher and higher 
        resolutions are tried ;
      <p> IanD reported <i>I have an 8MB 3dfusion PCI on a BX mobo Celeron 566 
        64MB RAM 66MHz FSB, with Dynalink Magic TView (Conexant 878) and can only 
        execute dTV at 16 bit colour depth. When running a 1024x768 desktop, dTV 
        v1.9 with a 720x576 @ 50Hz PAL composite input gives 0 DFS in manual Video 
        De-interlace mode for dTV window sizes up to 848x629 (as determined from 
        dtv.ini) but 7+ DFS for window sizes even 1 pixel above either of these 
        dimensions</i>
      <p> Bottom line ; no specific requirement for dTV. Probably works not so 
        bad on any vga card. However, as of today, GeForce based cards or (dualhead) 
        Matrox G4x0 are successfully used by a lot of users.
      <p> 
      <a name="BESTCARD"></a>
      <h2>Which capture card can I use ?</h2>
      <p> Almost any card (and that means A LOT) based of former Brooktree (now 
        Conexant) chips including bt848/878/879. Why those ? They are, for several 
        years now, the chipsets that are easy to program (there has been A LOT 
        of software based on those) and very cheap. Side effect ; a great number 
        of manufacturers have (and are still) produced cards based on those chipsets.
      <p> While we can't claim "this card is the one you need", let's give you 
        a couple ones that, at least, have been sucessfully used by some users 
        ;
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Zoltrix Genie TV <a href="http://www.zoltix.com/products/GenieTVspecs.htm">http://www.zoltix.com/products/GenieTVspecs.htm</a>

      </ul>
      Take a look at the <a href="card_support.htm">card list</a>. This will 
      never be complete so feel free to drop us an email reporting your experience 
      with dTV and your card.
      <p> <i>This list is originally based on the linux bttv driver on which the 
        program was originally based.</i>
      <p> 
      <h2>Can I use my existing <whatever> card's video input ?</h2>
      <p> Probably not. dTV is supporting (see previous question) the Brooktree/Conexant 
        chipset. Supporting others chipsets, while feasable, means some hard work 
        and some solid knowledges of those chipsets. And <b>unfortunately, no 
        recent vga card with video-in feature includes Brooktree/Conexant chipset</b>.<br>
        Gx00, Asus Deluxe etc... are thus not supported at the moment.
      <p> If you have some programming knowledge regarding the grab chipsets used 
        in those card, you might want to help us. See the "<a href="#HELP">How 
        can I help</a>" section.
      <p> 
      <h2>Can I use more than one video input ?</h2>
      <p> Some "nut" people (he's admitting it himself ;-) who are playing with 
        Picture In Picture a lot have asked if dTV could drive multiple cards 
        or multiple inputs.<br>
        A card allowing at worst 4 video inputs is manufactured by Leadtek. It's 
        the <a href="http://www.leadtek.com.tw/ewv605.htm">Winview 605</a>.
      <p> It is Brooktree based so it might work with dTV but clearly nothing 
        is done right now to drive multiple video inputs at the same time.
      <p> See the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004431.html">associated 
        topic</a> on AVS forum.
      <p> However, you can easily use your a/v receiver to switch between multiple 
        video inputs. Connect the monitor out of your equipement to your grab 
        card and all your video devices to video in connectors.

      <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
      <p> 
      <a name="PURPLESTRIPES"></a>
      <h2>What is this "purple stripes" issue ?</h2>
      <p> When feeding some analog sources to the combination grab card/dTV, some 
        numerous horizontal colores lines appear on the image.
      <p> See <a href="images/Mummy_MacrovisionOn.jpg">this picture</a> where 
        macrovision has been added to the video signal. The same video signal 
        <a href="images/Mummy_MacrovisionOff.jpg">without the macrovision protection</a> 
        is perfectly stripes-free.
      <p> This phenomenom seems to be, at least, <b>more visible when a macrovision 
        protected video signal is fed</b> to some grab cards but this has been 
        reported also (despite less visible) on unprotected material.
      <p> Other examples of this phenomenon can be seen here ;<br>

        Purple Stripes - is this capture card dependent?</a>
      <p> Some infos from the <a href="http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html">Dvd 
        Faq</a> ;
      <p> <i>"Macrovision adds a rapidly modulated colorburst signal ("Colorstripe") 
        along with pulses in the vertical blanking signal ("AGC") to the composite 
        video and s-video outputs. This confuses the synchronization and automatic-recording-level 
        circuitry in 95% of consumer VCRs. Unfortunately, it can degrade the picture, 
        especially with old or nonstandard equipment. Macrovision may show up 
        as stripes of color, distortion, rolling, black & white picture, and dark/light 
        cycling. Macrovision creates problems for many line doublers."</i>
      <p> Michael Eskin from Conexant found a way to limit this effet. You can 
        modify a parameter in your ini file to do so.
      <p> 
      <h2>I have slower system and&nbsp; I get some dropped frames ?</h2>
      <p>Some people experienced some dropped frames or extreme jerkiness on slower 
        machines, say less than 500 mhz. Some performance tuning parameters for 
        this are available in the [Threads] section of the <a href="IniFile.HTM">.ini 
        documentation</a>. Depending upon your graphics card you may also try 
        running with a lower screen resolution or color depth. Also try to limit 
        what else is running at the time, including System Tray applications that 
        may cause frequent interupts. </p>
      <a name="OVERLAY"></a>
      <h2>I get "overlay update" errors</h2>
      <p> Sometimes you get this error message <br>
        <code>Error calling overlay update. D:/source/deinterlace/dtv/other.c 
        at line 161</code><br>
        We don't have any full explanation of the problem but it happens when 
        resizing dTV or making it go from fullscreen to window mode. Also the 
        color depth, frequency and size of the desktop might be related.<br>
        The problem seems to have disappeared with dTV starting from version 2.0.0
      <p> Some more infos on this issue in <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004895.html">this 
        avs topic</a>
      <p> <b>WARNING</b> This will occur if you have an MPACT2 based card running 
        in 24bit mode.&nbsp; To use dTV with this card you must use a 16bit desktop

      <h1>How can I help ?</h1>
      <p> 
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p> More and more people are giving dTV a try. Why wouldn't you ? <br>
        We'd like to know about your experience with it. What does (not) work 
        ? What can be improved, what feature you'd like. Every feedback is useful.
      <p> Please report bugs on the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi">AV 
        Science Forum</a> after checking (using the search feature) that the problem 
        has not already been reported. Each bug report should include the hardware 
        you're using, especially video card, grab card and processor type and 
        speed. 
      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p> Any help is welcome. Despite including very complex code, there's a 
        lot of features in it that are simple or that could be easily implemented 
        without knowing anything about 3:2 pulldown detection.
      <p> If you've got an idea, or feel like to trying to implement something
