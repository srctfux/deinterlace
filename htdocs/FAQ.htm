      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2>What is DScaler ?</h2>
      <p> DScaler is a piece of software that grabs analog, interlaced video, 
        and deinterlaces it to make it a progressive scan feed then allows scaling 
        to any resolution for use on your computer monitor or projector.</p>
      <p> Analog, interlaced video is what devices like VCRs, laserdisc, and game 
        consoles output.</p>
      <h2>What is so special about DScaler ?</h2>
      <p> Unlike most existing software for use with TV cards, DScaler implements 
        sophisticated deinterlacing algorithms. Using such algorithms makes sure 
        that each kind of video source is handled a different way. It provides 
        the user with a level of image quality unknown to PC owners until now. 
      </p>
      <p> Some of the techniques are: 
      <ul>
        <li>video source deinterlacing</li>
        <li>inverse telecine detection: 2:2 (for pal movies) as well as 3:2 (for 
          ntsc movies) pulldown</li>
        <li>Automatic aspect ratio control</li>
        <li>Judder elimination</li>
      </ul>
      The image quality resulting from those complex operations is high and allows 
      some people equipped with data capable projectors to feed them with progressive 
      scan images. 
      <p></p>
      <h2>What is dTV ?</h2>
      <p>dTV is the old name for DScaler, we changed the name as people use dTV 
        to refer to digital television and this was causing confusion. In the 
        source and on the website you will still see references to dTV but please 
        refer to the program as DScaler from now on. </p>
      <h2>Who made what ?</h2>
      <p>See <a href="Authors.htm"> Authors</a> for the main contributors and 
        <a href="Thanks.htm">Thanks</a> for a list of people who have helped make 
        DScaler a success.</p>
      <h2>How much does DScaler cost ?</h2>
      <p> $1000 (plus taxes) :-) Of course not, DScaler is fully free of charge, 
        open-source, coded under GPL. 
      <h1>General issues</h1>
      <h2>Should I use DScaler to deinterlace the output from my set-top dvd player 
        ?</h2>
      <p> While it's feasible and works quite well (see the &quot;DScaler Windvd 
        challenge&quot; in the <a href="/screenshots/index.htm">screenshots</a> 
        section), home theatre PC's have shown the best results while using dvd 
        decoding software along with a dvd-rom and a modern graphics card. However, 
        there are people who find things easier to use with DScaler and an external 
        DVD player. 
      <p> Some people have found that DScaler does a better job with non-film 
        DVDs (concert videos or DVDs of some television shows, for example) than 
        the software players. 
      <h1>Software issues</h1>
      <h2>Which operating system can I use DScaler on ?</h2>
      <p> Windows 95 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0, may need ie 4.0 installed</i><br>
        Windows 98 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows NT ?? <i>may require hacked DirectX 5.0</i><br>
        Windows Me ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows 2000 ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br>
        Windows XP ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br>
        Linux no <i>if you want to do a port <a href="#HELP">contact us</a></i><br>
        OS/2 definitely no ;-) 
      <h2>What are all those deinterlace algorithms ?</h2>
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (Bob)</h3>
      <p> This method is based on Gunnar Thalin's VirtualDub filter.&nbsp; If 
        it detects weaving artifacts in the current image it uses bob to get rid 
        of them.&nbsp; This method has a tendency to bob rather too much and gives 
        poor results on fine static images. 
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (Weave)</h3>
      <p> Similar to Video Deinterlace (Bob), however this method has a tendency 
        to weave on moving images. 
      <h3>Video Deinterlace (2-Frame)</h3>
      <p>This method uses the current frame and the last two to determine whether 
        to bob or weave a given pixel. This gives better results on both stationary 
        and moving images than the above two methods however it uses more CPU. 
      <h3>Simple Weave</h3>
      <p> This method just combines the most recent even and odd fields.&nbsp; 
        This causes motion artifacts and is provided for comparison. 
      <h3>Simple Bob</h3>
      <p>This uses only the most recent field and fills the lines in between with 
        interpolated pixels.&nbsp; This method has in may ways been superceded 
        by Scaler BOB. 
      <h3>Blended Clip</h3>
      <p> The BLENDED CLIP Deinterlace method is designed mostly for experimentation 
        by those interested in what works for video deinterlacing. When it is 
        selected it will pop up a control panel with many controls to adjust various 
        parameters. These all correspond to Blc... parameters in the [Deinterlace] 
        section of the DScaler.ini file and are documented there. It is probably 
        not the single best method for anything but it can be used to create custom 
        deinterlace methods for special purposes. These can be saved in a separate 
        ini file and invoked by a command line parameter when starting DScaler.exe. 
        Somewhat CPU intensive 
      <h3> Scaler Bob</h3>
      <p> Uses the DirectDraw hardware bob feature (if available), this uses the 
        current field and lets the video card scaler size the picture to fit the 
        screen.&nbsp; Produces good results for fast moving images. 
      <h3> Even Fields Only<br>
        Odd Fields Only</h3>
      <p>These use only one field out of each pair and use hardware scaling.&nbsp; 
        This reduces bob artifacts at the cost of loss of information.&nbsp; These 
        were originally intended to be used with game consoles.
      <h3>Adaptive Deinterlace</h3>
      <p>This method uses the amount of motion detected to select the best deinterlacing 
        alogoritm.&nbsp; Currently by default it switches between 2-Frame and 
        weave. 
      <h3>Greedy deinterlace method</h3>
      <p> The GREEDY Deinterlace method is designed to give good results on low 
        motion video source, using less CPU than some others. Good on slower machines 
        but it will give awful results on high motion video material like sports. 
        Quite by accident, it can also do a decent job on poorly mastered 3:2 
        or 2:2 pull down film source material like some anime movies, regardless 
        of low or high motion. Try it if you have a movie source that is not giving 
        good results with normal Auto Pull Down processing.
      <h3>Greedy 2 Frame method</h3>
      <p>This method tries to combine the best features of the 2-frame algorithm 
        with the looking ahead ability of the greedy method.&nbsp; I find this 
        methods works well on sports and other high motion material.&nbsp; With 
        static images and low quality sources there may be unacceptable levels 
        of bobbing. 
      <h3>3:2 Pulldown, Skip Field X</h3>
      <p> Mostly on NTSC format, on a 24-fps film material, the material is encoded 
        as 48 fields (24 odd and 24 even). Each frame will be alternatingly played 
        3 and 2 times respectively. With regard to fields, the order played will 
        be come: Odd, Even, Odd (of frame 1) and Even, Odd (of Frame 2), and so 
        on. In order to create a pure progressive image (which is 1 frame of the 
        24-fps material), DScaler will only need to take the odd and even field, 
        weaves them together, skip the next odd frame and wait until the next 
        odd and even field arrives, weaves them together and put it out again. 
        In the field sequence, out of every 5 field, 1 field can be skipped. That 
        field that is skipped will be the number displayed on the pulldown Skip 
        Field. If all the sequences are coming in as perfect as described, and 
        DScaler detects it perfectly, the 3:2 pulldown method selected will always 
        be set the same. If the PC is rather slow (dropping fields), or the sequence 
        is altered (abruptly changing scenes), or DScaler's tolerance in comparison 
        is exceeded, it will retry to lock again to the 3:2 pulldown, and might 
        end up with a different field to skip. 
      <h3>2:2 Pulldown</h3>
      <p> PAL movies are made of sequences of 2:2 frames. Once such a sequence 
        is detected, the Odd and Even fields are taken, weaved to form 1 frame 
        of the 24-fps material, and displayed. 
      <h2>Can I <i>remote control</i> DScaler ? <b>YES</b></h2>
      <p> Yes you can. DScaler is being developped mainly by people using it as 
        an analog source scaler for their projector and they prefer for sure using 
        DScaler from their remote on the sofa rather than from their desk ;-) 
      <p> DScaler is thus filled with <a href="keyboard.htm">keyboard shortcuts</a> 
        for all main options so that you can do everything quickly.<br>
        More, we suggest the use of <a href="http://www.girder.nl">Girder</a> 
        from Ron Bessems as the application of choice for remote controlling your 
        computer. 
      <p> 
      <h2>Can I record video to my hard disk with DScaler?</h2>
      <p> No. DScaler isn't an all-in-one desktop video utility. The development 
        team has chosen to concentrate on making it the best video processor it 
        can be, and features like recording would require a lot of time and effort 
        we'd rather spend fine-tuning the deinterlacing algorithms or adding new 
        convenience features for aspect ratio control. 
      <p> If you want to record video, there are lots of alternatives to choose 
        from, such as: 
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="http://www.showshifter.com/">ShowShifter</a> for TiVo-like 
          features such as an integrated program guide and pausing of live TV. 
        <li> <a href="http://www.nct.ch/multimedia/avi_io">AVI_IO</a> is a video 
          recording application that specializes in keeping audio locked to video 
          even in the face of dropped frames. 
        <li> <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/">VirtualDub</a>, an open-source 
          desktop video application, can capture as well as edit and post-process 
          video. 
      </ul>
      <p> Of course, if you want to add video recording to DScaler, there's nothing 
        stopping you! That's what open source is all about. 
      <h1>Hardware issues</h1>
      <h2>Can I use any vga card as a display device ?</h2>
      <p> Despite this statement from Mark Rejhon ; 
      <p> &quot;DScaler requires an AGP card. It is impossible to do on a PCI 
        video card. DScaler uses massive amounts of *bidirectional* bus bandwidth: 
        250 megabits per second incoming bandwidth (from TV card) and about 500 
        megabits per second outgoing bandwidth (to videocard). This bus data firehose 
        is not feasible on PCI bus, as PCI can reliably continuously transfer 
        up to about 600-700 megabits per second *in one direction only* out of 
        a possible 1056 megabits per second (132 megabytes per second) due to 
        overhead. Try to go bidirectional, and framerate literally gets the death 
        penalty!" 
      <p> However, experience in the last monthes showed the some users were able 
        to use their PCI card with success and without dropped frames. In some 
        cases however, frame rate is going down when higher and higher resolutions 
        are tried ; 
      <p> IanD reported <i>I have an 8MB 3dfusion PCI on a BX mobo Celeron 566 
        64MB RAM 66MHz FSB, with Dynalink Magic TView (Conexant 878) and can only 
        execute DScaler at 16 bit colour depth. When running a 1024x768 desktop, 
        DScaler v1.9 with a 720x576 @ 50Hz PAL composite input gives 0 DFS in 
        manual Video De-interlace mode for DScaler window sizes up to 848x629 
        (as determined from DScaler.ini) but 7+ DFS for window sizes even 1 pixel 
        above either of these dimensions</i> 
      <p>At a minimum the display card must support YUV2 overlays. All newer cards 
        support this. </p>
      <a name="BESTCARD"></a> 
      <h2>Which capture card can I use ?</h2>
      <p> Almost any card (and that means A LOT) based of former Brooktree (now 
        Conexant) chips including bt848/878/879 will work for video only. Why 
        those ? These chips are easy to program (there has been A LOT of software 
        based on those) and very cheap. Side effect ; a great number of manufacturers 
        have (and are still) produced cards based on those chips. 
      <p> Sound from the tuner is not always supported and adding this for a lot 
        of cards is not a developement priority. </p>
      <p> While we can't claim "this card is the one you need", let's give you 
        a couple ones that, at least, have been sucessfully used by some users. 
      </p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p>Take a look at the <a href="/card-support/index.htm">card list</a>. This 
        will never be complete so feel free to drop us an email reporting your 
        experience with DScaler and your card. Also note that just because a card 
        is on the list does not mean that it will work properly. Some features 
        especially sound may not work correctly.</p>
      <p> <i>This list is originally based on the linux bttv driver on which the 
        program was originally based.</i> 
      <h2>Can I use my existing <whatever> card's video input ?</h2>
      <p> Probably not. DScaler is supporting (see previous question) the Brooktree/Conexant 
        chipset. Supporting others chipsets, while feasable, means some hard work 
        and some solid knowledge of those chipsets. And <b>unfortunately, no recent 
        vga card with video-in feature includes Brooktree/Conexant chipset</b>. 
        Gx00, Asus Deluxe, ATI All-in-Wonder etc... are thus not supported at 
        the moment. 
      <p> If you have some programming knowledge regarding the grab chipsets used 
        in those card, you might want to help us. See the "<a href="#HELP">How 
        can I help</a>" section. 
      <h2>Can I use more than one video input ?</h2>
      <p> Some "nut" people (he's admitting it himself ;-) who are playing with 
        Picture In Picture a lot have asked if DScaler could drive multiple cards 
        or multiple inputs. A card allowing at worst 4 video inputs has been manufactured 
        by Leadtek. It's the Winview 605. 
      <p> It is Brooktree based so it might work with DScaler but clearly nothing 
        is done right now to drive multiple video inputs at the same time. 
      <p> See the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Archives/Archive-000004/HTML/20010323-12-004431.html">associated 
        topic</a> on AVS forum. 
      <p> However, you can easily use your a/v receiver to switch between multiple 
        video inputs. Connect the monitor out of your equipement to your grab 
        card and all your video devices to video in connectors. 
      <p>Also, some cards come with one, sometimes two composite input that you 
        can use separately from within DScaler. An svideo connection is also quite 
        common, allowing you to switch easily from 2 or 3 sources.
      <p> <a name="TROUBLE"></a> 
      <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
      <h2> I have problems with sound?</h2>
      <p>Note that support for sound from cards internal tuners is not a priority 
        for most of the developers of DScaler.&nbsp; Almost all the developers 
        use some kind of external TV tuner and bypass the sound issue.&nbsp; Having 
        said that we will be pleased to accept fixes for any card but are not 
        in a position to add support for new cards ourselves. 
      <p> 
      <h2> My picture jumps up and down?<br>
        I get dropped frames?</h2>
      <p> Both problems seems to be caused by not having a powerful enough machine 
        to run everything all at the same time.&nbsp; The things that use up a 
        lot of CPU time are 2-Frame and Blended Clip deinterlacing and automatic 
        pulldown detection.&nbsp; Try moving to another pulldown method or switching 
        off autodetection.&nbsp; The other alternative is to buy a faster PC ;-))</p>
      <p> There is now a setting in Select Hardware which allows you to tell DScaler 
        how fast your PC is.&nbsp; Try selecting alower speed if you get either 
        of these problems.</p>
      <p> <a name="PURPLESTRIPES"></a> 
      <h2>What is this "purple stripes" issue ?</h2>
      <p> When feeding some analog sources to the combination grab card/DScaler, 
        some numerous horizontal colores lines appear on the image. 
      <p> See <a href="/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOn.jpg">this picture</a> where 
        macrovision has been added to the video signal. The same video signal 
        <a href="/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOff.jpg">without the macrovision protection</a> 
        is perfectly stripes-free. 
      <p> This phenomenom seems to be, at least, <b>more visible when a macrovision 
        protected video signal is fed</b> to some grab cards but this has been 
        reported also (despite less visible) on unprotected material. 
      <p> Other examples of this phenomenon can be seen here ;<br>

        Purple Stripes - is this capture card dependent?</a> 
      <p> Some infos from the <a href="http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html">Dvd 
        Faq</a> ; 
      <p> <i>"Macrovision adds a rapidly modulated colorburst signal ("Colorstripe") 
        along with pulses in the vertical blanking signal ("AGC") to the composite 
        video and s-video outputs. This confuses the synchronization and automatic-recording-level 
        circuitry in 95% of consumer VCRs. Unfortunately, it can degrade the picture, 
        especially with old or nonstandard equipment. Macrovision may show up 
        as stripes of color, distortion, rolling, black & white picture, and dark/light 
        cycling. Macrovision creates problems for many line doublers."</i> 
      <p> <b>WARNING</b> This has been reported only when feeding, for test purposes, 
        a dvd player to the computer. Problems on other type of sources have yet 
        to be shown. 
      <p>So in common cases, you don't have to worry about this. 
      <h2>I get "overlay update" errors</h2>
      <p> Sometimes you get this error message <br>
        <code>Error calling overlay update. D:/source/deinterlace/DScaler/other.c 
        at line 161</code><br>
        We don't have any full explanation of the problem but it happens when 
        resizing DScaler or making it go from fullscreen to window mode. Also 
        the color depth, frequency and size of the desktop might be related. 
      <h2>I still have a problem?</h2>
      <p>See <a href="user_support.htm">Support</a> for how to get support for 
        DScaler. </p>
      <a name="HELP"></a> 
      <h1>How can I help ?</h1>
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>More and more people are giving DScaler a try. Why don't you?<br>
        We'd like to know about your experience with it. What does (not) work? 
        What can be improved, what features you would like. All feedback is useful. 
      <p>Please report bugs on the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi">AV 
        Science Forum</a> after checking (using the search feature) that the problem 
        has not already been reported. Each bug report should include the hardware 
        you're using, especially video card, grab card and processor type and 
        speed.</p>
      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p> Any help is welcome. Despite including very complex code, there are 
        a lot of features in it that are simple or that could be easily implemented 
        without knowing anything about 3:2 pulldown detection.
      <p> If you've got an idea, or feel like to trying to implement something 
        that is already in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_project_id=7174&group_id=7420&func=browse">Tasks
