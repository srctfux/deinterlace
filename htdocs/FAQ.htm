      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> 
      <h2>What is dTV ?</h2>
      <p> dTV is a piece of software that grabs analog, interlaced video, and 
        deinterlace it to make it a progressive scan feed for use on your computer 
        monitor or projector. 
      <p> Analog, interlaced video is what output devices like vcr, laserdisc, 
        game consoles ... 
      <h2><br>
        What is so special about dTV ?</h2>
      <p> Unlike most existing software that tries to do the same, dTV implements 
        very sophisticated algorithms to deinterlace such sources. Using such 
        algorithms makes sure that each kind of video source is handled a different 
        way. It provides the user with a level of image quality unknown to PC 
        owners up to now. 
      <p> Some of those techniques are ; 
      <ul>
        <li>video source deinterlacing</li>
        <li>inverse telecine detection</li>
        <li>2:2 (for pal movies) as well as 3:2 (for ntsc movies) pulldown</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The image quality resulting from those complex operations is high and 
        allows some people equipped with data capable projectors to feed them 
        with a progressive scan source that was interlaced right before. 
      <h2><br>
        Who made what ?</h2>
      <p>See <a href="Authors.htm">dTV -- Authors</a> for the main contributors
      and <a href="Thanks.htm">dTV -- Thanks</a> for a list of people who have
      helped make dTV a success. 
      <h1><br>
        General issues</h1>
      <h2>Should I use dTV to deinterlace the output from my set-top player ?</h2>
      <p> While it's feasible and works quite fine (see the "dTV WinDVD challenge" 
        in the <a href="screenshots/index.htm">screenshots</a> section), home theater 
        PC's have shown the best results while using dvd decoding software along 
        with a dvd-rom and a modern graphic card.<br>
        However, it's been used quite often for test purposes (testing of grab 
        quality on a high quality source, testing pulldown techniques on well 
        encoded sources etc..). 
      <h1><br>
        Software issues</h1>
      <h2>Which operating system can I use dTV on ?</h2>
      <p> Windows 95 ok<br>
        Windows 98 OK<br>
        Windows NT ok<i> requires that a VxD runs in ring-0 (nt ultra low level 
        part of the os</i><br>
        Windows Me ok <i>tested with an Hauppage 401 without problem</i><br>
        Windows 2000 ok<br>
        Linux no<br>
        OS/2 definitely no ;-) 
      <h2>
        When taking a snapshot, dTV outputs ppm files, what are those ?</h2>
      <p> It's called Portable PixMap. Actually, this is the only graphic file 
        code that John Adcock had when writing dTV ;-)<br>
        It's perfectly handled by several applications including 
      <ul>
        <li>ACDSee 3 <a href="http://www.acdsystems.com/english/products/acdsee/index.htm">http://www.acdsystems.com/english/products/acdsee/index.htm</a> 
        <li>Irfanview <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/english.htm">http://www.irfanview.com/english.htm</a> 
        <li>Paint Shop Pro <a href="http://www.jasc.com/product.asp?pf%5Fid=001">http://www.jasc.com/product.asp?pf%5Fid=001</a> 
      </ul>
      <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
      <h2>
        Can I <i>remote control</i> dTV ? <b>YES</b></h2>
      <p> Yes you can. dTV is being developed mainly by people using it as an 
        analog source scaler for their projector and they prefer for sure using 
        dTV from their remote on the sofa rather than from their desk ;-) 
      <p> dTV is thus filled with <a href="keyboard.htm">keyboard shortcuts</a> 
        for all main options so that you can do everything quickly.<br>
        More, we suggest the use of <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~stilgar/windoze/girder.html">Girder</a> 
        from Ron Bessems as the application of choice for remote controlling your 
        computer. 
      <h1>Hardware issues</h1>
      <h2>Can I use any vga card as a display device ?</h2>
      <p> Despite this statement from Mark Rejhon ; 
      <p> "dTV requires an AGP card. It is impossible to do on a PCI video card. 
        dTV uses massive amounts of *bi-directional* bus bandwidth: 250 megabits 
        per second incoming bandwidth (from TV card) and about 500 megabits per 
        second outgoing bandwidth (to video card). This bus data firehose is not 
        feasible on PCI bus, as PCI can reliably continuously transfer up to about 
        600-700 megabits per second *in one direction only* out of a possible 
        1056 megabits per second (132 megabytes per second) due to overhead. Try 
        to go bi-directional, and framerate literally gets the death penalty!" 
      <p> However, experience in the last months showed the some users were able 
        to use their PCI card with success and without dropped frames. In some 
        cases however, frame rate is going down when higher and higher resolutions 
        are tried ; 
      <p> IanD reported <i>I have an 8MB 3dfusion PCI on a BX mobo Celeron 566 
        64MB RAM 66MHz FSB, with Dynalink Magic TView (Conexant 878) and can only 
        execute dTV at 16 bit colour depth. When running a 1024x768 desktop, dTV 
        v1.9 with a 720x576 @ 50Hz PAL composite input gives 0 DFS in manual Video 
        De-interlace mode for dTV window sizes up to 848x629 (as determined from 
        dtv.ini) but 7+ DFS for window sizes even 1 pixel above either of these 
        dimensions</i> 
      <p> Bottom line ; no specific requirement for dTV. Probably works not so 
        bad on any vga card. However, as of today, GeForce based cards or (dualhead) 
        Matrox G400 are successfully used by a lot of users. 
      <p> <a name="BESTCARD"></a> 
      <h2><br>
        Which capture card can I use ?</h2>
      <p> Almost any card (and that means A LOT) based of former Brooktree (now 
        Conexant) chips including bt848/878/879. Why those ? They are, for several 
        years now, the chipsets that are easy to program (there has been A LOT 
        of software based on those) and very cheap. Side effect ; a great number 
        of manufacturers have (and are still) produced cards based on those chipsets. 
      <p> While we can't claim "this card is the one you need", let's give you 
        a couple ones that, at least, have been successfully used by some users 
        ; 
      <ul>
        <li>Zoltrix Genie TV <a href="http://www.zoltix.com/products/GenieTVspecs.htm">http://www.zoltix.com/products/GenieTVspecs.htm</a> 
        <li>The WinTV series from Hauppage <a href="http://www.hauppage.com/html/products.htm">http://www.hauppage.com/html/products.htm</a> 
        <li>Guillemot maxi video 3 <a href="http://fr.guillemot.com/brand/gamme/video/mtvvidp3/mtvvidpci3.html">http://fr.guillemot.com/brand/gamme/video/mtvvidp3/mtvvidpci3.html</a> 
        <li>The Pinnacle Studio PCTV <a href="http://www.pinnaclesys.com/ProductPage.asp?Product_ID=6">http://www.pinnaclesys.com/ProductPage.asp?Product_ID=6</a> 
      </ul>
      <p>Take a look at the <a href="card-support/index.htm">card list</a>. This will 
        never be complete so feel free to drop us an email reporting your experience 
        with dTV and your card. </p>
      <p> <i>This list is originally based on the linux bttv driver on which the 
        program was originally based.</i> 
      <p>&nbsp;
      <h2>Can I use my existing <whatever> video card's video input ?</h2>
      <p> Probably not. dTV is supporting (see previous question) the Brooktree/Conexant 
        chipset. Supporting others chipsets, while feasible, means some hard work 
        and some solid knowledge of those chipsets. And <b>unfortunately, no recent 
        vga card with video-in feature includes Brooktree/Conexant chipset</b>. 
        Gx00, Asus Deluxe etc... are thus not supported at the moment. 
      <p> If you have some programming knowledge regarding the grab chipsets used 
        in those card, you might want to help us. See the "<a href="#HELP">How 
        can I help</a>" section. 
      <h2><br>
        Can I use more than one video input ?</h2>
      <p> Some "nut" people (he's admitting it himself ;-) who are playing with 
        Picture In Picture a lot have asked if dTV could drive multiple cards 
        or multiple inputs. A card allowing at worst 4 video inputs is manufactured 
        by Leadtek. It's the <a href="http://www.leadtek.com.tw/ewv605.htm">Winview 
        605</a>. 
      <p> It is Brooktree based so it might work with dTV but clearly nothing 
        is done right now to drive multiple video inputs at the same time. 
      <p> See the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004431.html">associated 
        topic</a> on AVS forum.

      <h2>What is this "purple stripes" issue ?</h2>
      <p> <i><b>UPDATE: </b>Michael Eskin of Conexant Systems Inc. has fixed
      this issue with an adjustable INI file setting, as of dTV version 2.0.1</i>
      <p> When feeding some analog sources to the combination grab card/dTV, some 
        numerous horizontal colored lines appear on the image. 
      <p> See <a href="/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOn.jpg">this picture</a> where 
        macrovision has been added to the video signal. The same video signal 
        <a href="/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOff.jpg">without the macrovision protection</a> 
        is perfectly stripes-free. 
      <p> This phenomenon seems to be, at least, <b>more visible when a macrovision 
        protected video signal is fed</b> to some grab cards but this has been 
        reported also (despite less visible) on unprotected material. 
      <p> Other examples of this phenomenon can be seen here ;<br>

        Purple Stripes - is this capture card dependent?</a> 
      <p> Some info from the <a href="http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html">Dvd 
        Faq</a> ; 
      <p> <i>"Macrovision adds a rapidly modulated colorburst signal ("Colorstripe") 
        along with pulses in the vertical blanking signal ("AGC") to the composite 
        video and s-video outputs. This confuses the synchronization and automatic-recording-level 
        circuitry in 95% of consumer VCRs. Unfortunately, it can degrade the picture, 
        especially with old or nonstandard equipment. Macrovision may show up 
        as stripes of color, distortion, rolling, black & white picture, and dark/light 
        cycling. Macrovision creates problems for many line doublers."</i> 
      <p> <b>WARNING</b> This has been reported only when feeding, for test purposes, 
        a dvd player to the computer. Problems on other type of sources have yet 
        to be shown. 
      <p>So in common cases, you don't have to worry about this. 
      <h2>I have slower system and&nbsp; I get some dropped frames ?</h2>
      <p>Some people experienced some dropped frames or extreme jerkiness on
      slower machines, say less than 500 mhz. Some performance tuning parameters
      for this are available in the [Threads] section of the <a href="IniFile.HTM">.ini documentation</a>.
      Depending upon your graphics card you may also try running with a lower
      screen resolution or color depth. Also try to limit what else is running
      at the time, including System Tray applications that may cause frequent
      interupts. </p>
      <h2>
        Despite a very powerful system, I've still got some dropped frames ?</h2>
      <p>Some people experienced some dropped frames (signs of a machine that 
        has problems keeping up with the workload of dTV) even on powerful systems. 
        An hypothesis is that a motherboard agp speed issue might be the cause 
        of such behavior.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> JackB reported <i>We looked at his BIOS settings and the only major 
        difference is that his had a 4X AGP mode and my MB only has a 2X AGP mode 
        <snip>We put my video card, a GeForce2 MX, in his (slower supposedly) 
        system and it ran 0 DFS. So it's not the MX throughput that's the problem. 
        So, I'm down to it's my motherboard not being up to speed in either AGP 
        acceleration or I have some settings set incorrectly</i> 
      <p> <a name="OVERLAY"></a> 
      <h2><br>
        I get "overlay update" errors</h2>
      <p>This will occur if you have an MPACT2 based card running in 24bit
      mode.&nbsp; To use dTV with this card you must use a 16bit desktop mode.<p> Sometimes you get this error message <code>Error calling overlay update. 
        D:/source/deinterlace/dtv/other.c at line ???</code><br>
        We don't have any full explanation of the problem but it happens when 
        resizing dTV or making it go from fullscreen to window mode. Also the 
        color depth, frequency and size of the desktop might be related.<br>
        The problem seems to have disappeared with dTV starting from version 2.0.0 
      <p> Some more info on this issue in <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004895.html">this

      <h1>
        How can I help ?</h1>
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p> More and more people are giving dTV a try. Why don't you ? <br>
        We'd like to know about your experience with it. What does (not) work 
        ? What can be improved, what feature you'd like to see. All feedback is useful.<p> Please
      report bugs on the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi">AV Science 
        Forum</a> after checking (using the search feature) that the problem has
      not already been reported. Each bug report should include the hardware you're using, especially video card,
      grab card and processor type and speed. 
      <h2>
        Coding</h2>
      <p> Any help is welcome. Despite including very complex code, there's a 
        lot of features in it that are simple or that could be easily implemented 
        without knowing anything about 3:2 pulldown detection.
      <p> dTV could especially use some more programmers interested in adding
      advanced sound or closed captioning features.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <p> If you've got an idea, or feel like to trying to implement something 
        that is already in the <a href="Todo.htm">Todo list</a>, contact the 
        authors and join the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=7420">mailing
