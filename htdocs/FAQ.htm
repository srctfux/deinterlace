      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <h2>What is DScaler ?</h2>

      <p>DScaler is a piece of software that grabs analog, interlaced video,
      and deinterlaces it to make it a progressive scan feed then allows
      scaling to any resolution for use on your computer monitor or
      projector.</p>

      <p>Analog, interlaced video is what devices like VCRs, laserdisc, and
      game consoles output.</p>

      <h2>What is so special about DScaler ?</h2>

      <p>Unlike most existing software for use with TV cards, DScaler
      implements sophisticated deinterlacing algorithms. Using such algorithms
      makes sure that each kind of video source is handled a different way. It
      provides the user with a level of image quality unknown to PC owners
      until now.</p>

      <p>Some of the techniques are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>video source deinterlacing</li>

        <li>inverse telecine detection: 2:2 (for pal movies) as well as 3:2
        (for ntsc movies) pulldown</li>

        <li>Automatic aspect ratio control</li>

        <li>Judder elimination</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The image quality resulting from those complex operations is high and
      allows some people equipped with data capable projectors to feed them
      with progressive scan images.</p>

      <h2>What is dTV ?</h2>

      <p>dTV is the old name for DScaler, we changed the name as people use dTV
      to refer to digital television and this was causing confusion. In the
      source and on the website you will still see references to dTV but please
      refer to the program as DScaler from now on.</p>

      <h2>History of DScaler</h2>

      <p>The whole thing started in July 2000. See Cliff Watson's post
      regarding the home theater computer history in "<a href=
      "http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/012706.html#7">Who are the
      pioneers of htpc ?</a>". Ali, one of the first French htpc addicts, was
      promoting a piece of software called <a href=
      "http://www.borgtech.org/">BorgTV</a> (aka bTV) that allowed him to
      deinterlace analog sources with a level of quality unknown at this time.
      Thanks to threads like " <a href=
      "http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Archives/Archive-000004/HTML/20010102-12-002950.html">
      Not so bad analog video deinterlacing with htpc</a>", people got
      interested in the subject. Among them was <a href="Authors.htm">John
      Adcock</a>.</p>

      <p>He released a plugin for bTV that was doing realtime 2:2 pulldown for
      PAL movies that showed that deinterlacing of such sources was feasable in
      software (see " <a href=
      "http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Archives/Archive-000004/HTML/20010102-12-003461.html">
      John Adock's great PALMovie plugin</a>").</p>

      <p>The lack of NTSC support in bTV made the implementation of the more
      complex 3:2 pulldown algorithm lead John to write his own application
      based on Multidec. Its name, based on its inspiration application, was
      dTV (see " <a href=
      "http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Archives/Archive-000004/HTML/20010714-12-003790.html">
      First Version of NTSC/PAL TV deinterlacing program</a>").</p>

      <p>The first versions only had manual film pulldown selction. The next
      major breakthrough was when John implemented Mark Rejhon's 3:2 pulldown
      algorithm.</p>

      <p>This proved that complex deinterlacing techniques could be done in
      realtime and without additionnal dedicated hardware. Since this time,
      more and more users (and coders) have joined the dTV community and are
      using it on their htpc rather than using external line doublers.</p>

      <p>In may 2001, <a href=
      "http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/010323.html">dTV got renamed to
      DScaler</a> to avoid any misunderstanding with the growing Digital
      TeleVision issue.</p>

      <p>See <a href="Authors.htm">Authors</a> for the main contributors and
      <a href="Thanks.htm">Thanks</a> for a list of people who have helped make
      DScaler a success.</p>

      <h2>How much does DScaler cost ?</h2>

      <p>DScaler is free software, open-source, coded under the <a href=
      "http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL Licence</a>.</p>

      <h2>Can I ship DScaler with machines I make ?<br />
      Can I redistribute DScaler ?</h2>

      <p>DScaler is released under the <a href=
      "http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> and as such you are
      free to redistribute DScaler provided you agree to also distribute the
      source code. Note that <b>simple linking to our site is not enough</b>.
      Also it would be nice to <a href=
      "mailto:deinterlace-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net">hear</a> from anybody
      who is shipping this product as we can add a link to your site and keep
      track of who is using our software.</p>

      <h2>Where can I download DScaler?</h2>

      <p>Official releases are placed on DScaler's site, on the <a href=
      "http://www.dscaler.org/downloads.htm">download page</a></p>

      <p>From time to time the developers release alpha test versions, these
      version are often unstable but will have all the latest features. These
      versions are not recommended generally and are only supported via the
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=7420">developers mailing
      list</a>. The test downloads can be found <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7420">here</a></p>

      <h1>General issues</h1>

      <h2>Should I use DScaler to deinterlace the output from my set-top dvd
      player ?</h2>

      <p>While it is feasible and works quite well (see the "DScaler Windvd
      challenge" in the <a href=
      "http://www.dscaler.org/screenshots/index.htm">screenshots</a> section),
      home theatre PC's have shown the best results while using dvd decoding
      software along with a dvd-rom and a modern graphics card. However, there
      are people who find it easier to use with DScaler with an external DVD
      player.</p>

      <p>Some people have found that DScaler does a better job with non-film
      DVDs (e.g. concert videos or DVDs of some television shows) and poorly
      coded DVDs (e.g. Anime) than the software players.</p>

      <p>Note that most DVD players implement Macrovision copy controls, these
      can interfere with DScaler. For futher information see <a href=
      "#PURPLESTRIPES">"What is the purple stripes issue ?"</a> below</p>

      <h1>Software issues</h1>

      <h2>Which operating system can I use DScaler on ?</h2>

      <p>Windows 95 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0, may need ie 4.0
      installed</i><br />
      Windows 98 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br />
      Windows NT ?? <i>may require hacked DirectX 5.0</i><br />
      Windows Me ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br />
      Windows 2000 ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br />
      Windows XP ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br />
      Linux no <i>if you want to do a port <a href="#HELP">contact
      us</a></i><br />
      OS/2 definitely no ;-)</p>

      <h2>What are all those deinterlace algorithms ?</h2>

      <p>Look for a detailed description in the <a href=
      "Help/Deinterlace.htm">online help file</a>.</p>

      <h2>Can I <i>remote control</i> DScaler ? <b>YES</b></h2>

      <p>Yes you can. DScaler is being developped mainly by people using it as
      an analog source scaler for their projector and they prefer for sure
      using DScaler from their remote on the sofa rather than from their desk
      ;-)</p>

      <p>DScaler is thus filled with <a href="keyboard.htm">keyboard
      shortcuts</a> for all main options so that you can do everything
      quickly.</p>

      <p>We also suggest the use of <a href="http://www.girder.nl">Girder</a>
      from Ron Bessems as the application of choice for remote controlling your
      computer. An export group has been developped. Download it <a href=
      "http://www.girder.nl/download.php?Link=172">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Can I record video to my hard disk with DScaler?</h2>

      <p>Sort of. DScaler now handles basic recording and playback of
      specifically-formatted AVI files using a compression codec of your
      choice. The end goal being a "time shifting" feature (i.e. pausing of
      live TV) and not a generic video file processor. In other words, it
      handles only the video files that it creates itself for this purpose.
      This is all currently under construction.</p>

      <p>DScaler isn't intended to be an all-in-one desktop video utility. The
      development team has chosen to concentrate on making it the best video
      processor it can be.</p>

      <p>If you want to record video, there are lots of alternatives to choose
      from, such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/">VirtualDub</a>, an open-source
        desktop video application, can capture as well as edit and post-process
        video.</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.showshifter.com/">ShowShifter</a> for TiVo-like
        features such as an integrated program guide and pausing of live
        TV.</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.nct.ch/multimedia/avi_io">AVI_IO</a> is a video
        recording application that specializes in keeping audio locked to video
        even in the face of dropped frames.</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.snapstream.com/">Snapstream</a> PVS is another
        comparable product.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Of course, if you want to improve DScaler's video recording, there's
      nothing stopping you! That's what open source is all about.</p>

      <h1>Hardware issues</h1>

      <h2>Can I use any vga card as a display device ?</h2>

      <p>This is what Mark Rejhon has to say about this:</p>

      <p>"DScaler requires an AGP card. It is impossible to do on a PCI video
      card. DScaler uses massive amounts of *bidirectional* bus bandwidth: 250
      megabits per second incoming bandwidth (from TV card) and about 500
      megabits per second outgoing bandwidth (to videocard). This bus data
      firehose is not feasible on PCI bus, as PCI can reliably continuously
      transfer up to about 600-700 megabits per second *in one direction only*
      out of a possible 1056 megabits per second (132 megabytes per second) due
      to overhead. Try to go bidirectional, and framerate literally gets the
      death penalty!"</p>

      <p>However, some users ahve reported that they are able to use their PCI
      card successfully and without dropped frames. In some cases however,
      frame rate goes down when higher and higher resolutions are tried.</p>

      <p>Ian Darian reported <i>I have an 8MB 3dfusion PCI on a BX mobo Celeron
      566 64MB RAM 66MHz FSB, with Dynalink Magic TView (Conexant 878) and can
      only execute DScaler at 16 bit colour depth. When running a 1024x768
      desktop, DScaler v1.9 with a 720x576 @ 50Hz PAL composite input gives 0
      DFS in manual Video De-interlace mode for DScaler window sizes up to
      848x629 (as determined from DScaler.ini) but 7+ DFS for window sizes even
      1 pixel above either of these dimensions</i></p>

      <p>At a minimum the display card must support YUY2 overlays. All newer
      cards support this.</p><a name="BESTCARD" id="BESTCARD"></a>

      <h2>Which capture card can I use ?</h2>

      <p>Almost any card (and that means A LOT) based of former Brooktree (now
      Conexant) chips including bt848/878/879 will work for video only. Why
      those ? These chips are easy to program (there has been A LOT of software
      based on those) and are very cheap. This means many manufacturers have
      (and are still) produced cards based on those chips.</p>

      <p>Sound from the tuner is not always supported and adding this for a lot
      of cards is not a developement priority.</p>

      <p>While we can't (and won't) claim "this card is the one you need", here
      are a few that have been sucessfully used by some users.</p>

      </ul>

      <p>Take a look at the <a href=
      "http://www.dscaler.org/card-support/index.htm">card list</a>. This will
      never be complete so feel free to drop us an email reporting your
      experience with DScaler and your card. Also note that just because a card
      is on the list does not mean that it will work properly. Some features
      especially sound may not work correctly.</p>

      <p><i>This list is originally based on the linux bttv driver on which the
      program was originally based.</i></p>

      <h2>How can I get the best out of your grab card ? What is calibration
      ?</h2>

      <p>DScaler drives the Bt chip to do an analog/digital conversion of the
      video source you're using. You can tweak some parameters linked to this
      process to get a digital image as close as possible as the original.
      Color, contrast are such parameters. Use the "Video adjustement" menu or
      <a href="keyboard.htm#adjust">shortcut keys</a>.</p>

      <p>The calibration is a procedure using test patterns which allows to
      find the best video settings for the capture card.</p>

      <p>DScaler is able to analyze certain test patterns from commercial DVD
      and then adjust the video settings of the capture card so that the output
      signal from the capture card is the closest as possible with the real
      content of the test pattern stored on the disc.</p>

      <p>Details about the calibration feature can be found <a href=
      "Help/Calibration.htm">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Can I use my existing &lt;whatever&gt; card's video input ?</h2>

      <p>Probably not. DScaler currently only supports the Brooktree/Conexant
      chipset (see previous question). Supporting others chipsets, while
      feasable, means some hard work and some solid knowledge of those
      chipsets. And <b>unfortunately, no recent vga card with video-in feature
      includes Brooktree/Conexant chipset</b>. Gx00, Asus Deluxe, ATI
      All-in-Wonder etc... are thus not supported for video input at the
      moment.</p>

      <p>If you have some programming knowledge regarding the grab chipsets
      used in those card, you might want to help us. See the "<a href=
      "#HELP">How can I help</a>" section.</p>

      <h2>Can I use more than one video input ?</h2>

      <p>Not currently although it is a work in progress.</p>

      <p>However, you can easily use your a/v receiver to switch between
      multiple video inputs. Connect the monitor out of your equipement to your
      grab card and all your video devices to video in connectors.</p>

      <p>Also, some cards come with one, sometimes two composite input that you
      can use separately from within DScaler. An svideo connection is also
      quite common, allowing you to switch easily from 2 or 3 sources.</p>

      <p><a name="TROUBLE" id="TROUBLE"></a></p>

      <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

      <h2>I have problems with sound?</h2>

      <p>Note that support for sound from cards internal tuners is not a
      priority for most of the developers of DScaler.&nbsp; Almost all the
      developers use some kind of external TV tuner and bypass the sound
      issue.&nbsp; Having said that we will be pleased to accept fixes for any
      card but are not in a position to add support for new cards
      ourselves.</p>

      <h2>My picture jumps up and down?<br />
      I get dropped frames?</h2>

      <p>Both problems seem to be caused by not having a powerful enough
      machine to run everything all at the same time.&nbsp; The things that use
      up a lot of CPU time are 2-Frame, Blended Clip &amp; Greedy deinterlacing
      and automatic pulldown detection.&nbsp; Try moving to another pulldown
      method or switching off autodetection.&nbsp; The other alternative is to
      buy a faster PC ;-))</p>

      <p>There is now a setting in Select Hardware which allows you to tell
      DScaler how fast your PC is.&nbsp; Try selecting alower speed if you get
      either of these problems.</p>

      <p><a name="PURPLESTRIPES" id="PURPLESTRIPES"></a></p>

      <h2>What is this "purple stripes" issue ?</h2>

      <p>When feeding some analog sources to the combination grab card/DScaler,
      horizontal colored lines appear on the image.</p>

      <p>See <a href=
      "http://www.dscaler.org/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOn.jpg">this picture</a>
      where macrovision has been added to the video signal. The same video
      signal <a href=
      "http://www.dscaler.org/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOff.jpg">without the
      macrovision protection</a> is perfectly stripes-free.</p>

      <p>This phenomenom seems to be <b>more visible when a macrovision
      protected video signal is fed</b> to some grab cards but this has been
      reported (although less visibly) on unprotected material.</p>

      <p>Other examples of this phenomenon can be seen here ;<br />
      <a href=
      "http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Archives/Archive-000004/HTML/20010323-12-004317.html">
      avs:MacroVision side effect</a><br />
      <a href=
      "http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004436.html">avs:DScaler Purple
      Stripes - is this capture card dependent?</a></p>

      <p>Some information from the <a href=
      "http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html">Dvd Faq</a> ;</p>

      <p><i>"Macrovision adds a rapidly modulated colorburst signal
      ("Colorstripe") along with pulses in the vertical blanking signal ("AGC")
      to the composite video and s-video outputs. This confuses the
      synchronization and automatic-recording-level circuitry in 95% of
      consumer VCRs. Unfortunately, it can degrade the picture, especially with
      old or nonstandard equipment. Macrovision may show up as stripes of
      color, distortion, rolling, black &amp; white picture, and dark/light
      cycling. Macrovision creates problems for many line doublers."</i></p>

      <p><b>WARNING</b> This has been reported only when feeding, for test
      purposes, a dvd player to the computer. Problems on other type of sources

      <p>So in common cases, you don't have to worry about this.</p>

      <h2>Despite having a very powerful system, I still get some dropped
      frames?</h2>

      <p>Some people experienced some dropped frames (signs of a machine that
      has problems keeping up with the workload of DScaler) even on powerful
      systems. An hypothesis is that some motherboard agp speed issue might be
      the cause of such behavior.</p>

      <p>JackB reported <i>We looked at his BIOS settings and the only major
      difference is that his had a 4X AGP mode and my MB only has a 2X AGP
      mode. &lt;snip&gt; We put my video card, a GeForce2 MX, in his(slower
      supposedly)system and it ran 0 DFS. So it's not the MX throughput that's
      the problem. So, I'm down to it's my motherboard not being up to speed in
      either AGP acceleration or I have some settings set incorrectly</i></p>

      <h2>I get "overlay update" errors</h2>

      <p>Sometimes you get this error message<br />
      <code>Error calling overlay update. D:/source/deinterlace/DScaler/other.c
      at line ???</code><br />
      We don't have any full explanation of the problem but it happens when
      resizing DScaler or making it go from fullscreen to window mode. Also the
      color depth, frequency and size of the desktop might be related.</p>

      <h2>What is the Crashlog.txt file, and where do I find it ?</h2>

      <p>If one of the developers asks you for a crashlog.txt file you should
      find this file in the DScaler install directory. This file contains
      useful information that can be used to find bugs more easily. If you
      can't find one when you've been asked for one don't worry just inform the
      developer that one was not created. Also if you have this file but are
      not observing problems then don't worry.</p>

      <h2>I still have a problem?</h2>

      <p>See <a href="user_support.htm">Support</a> for how to get support for
      DScaler.</p><a name="HELP" id="HELP"></a>

      <h1>How can I help ?</h1>

      <h2>Testing</h2>

      <p>More and more people are giving DScaler a try. Why don't you?<br />
      We'd like to know about your experience with it. What does (not) work?
      What can be improved, what features you would like. All feedback is
      useful.</p>

      <p>Please report bugs on the <a href=
      "http://www.avsforum.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi">AV Science Forum</a> after
      checking (using the search feature) that the problem has not already been
      reported. Each bug report should include the hardware you're using,
      especially video card, grab card and processor type and speed.</p>

      <h2>Coding</h2>

      <p>Any help is welcome. Despite including some very complex code, there
      are a lot of features in that are simple or that could be easily
      implemented without having to wade through all the assembler.</p>

      <p>If you've got an idea, or feel like to trying to implement something
      that is already in the <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_project_id=7174&amp;group_id=7420&amp;func=browse">
      Tasks list</a>, join the <a href=
