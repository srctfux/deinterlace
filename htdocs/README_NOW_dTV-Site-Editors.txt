When Editing dTV Website,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- PLEASE use relative paths, not absolute paths.

- PLEASE create subdirectories, for major new sections, to keep the site organized.

- PLEASE use the images subdirectory mainly for frequently used or global images only,
  keep the images together with the subdirectories wherever applicable
  (ie setup subdir, screenshot subdir, etc)




Major Internal Structure Changes 11/28/2000 by Mark Rejhon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Download and News webpages merged

- Whole website categorized into multiple subdirectories

- Whole website modified to use relative paths.

- For certain subdirectories (ie setup subdir), moved images into the directory from images subdir.

- FrontPage 2000 was used; seems to work okay and doesn't muck things up.
