************* This is the DScaler FAQ log 



It contains, and kept in cvs repository, all updates made to the *MASTER ENGLISH VERSION* off the FAQ.

Every translated version should be upated according to, AND ONLY FROM, this log and the english FAQ.

I repeat ; any update should be done first on the MASTER version which is the english one.

The "last update" comment is added to any FAQ version on the site as soon as it's modified and committed into cvs.
Use this info to check what are the changes that you still haven't reported on the version you maintain.

Please add your name to your updates.

Any questions regarding the FAQ should go to me, Yvonus, at yvonus@removethis_bigfoot.com

. Added Michael Eskin in the developer's list

xxx" as we're still getting such errors

an a/v receiver to switch between multiple video inputs
