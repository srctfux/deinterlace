. (JA) Corrected OS section

24/1
. Description of "Blended clip updated"
. Added description of "Greedy deinterlace"

21/1
. Added Michael Eskin in the developer's list
. The "what are ppm files" section has been updated and shown as
"deprecated" as we're not outputting TIFF files
. Removed the "dTV export group" in the "Can I remote control dTV" as I now
think that export groups are quite difficult to maintain. A lot less easier
then Pronto's CCF files :-)
. Updated the G400 to G4x0 in "Can I use any vga card..."
. Update the "overlay update" ; removed the "has disappeared since version
xxx" as we're still getting such errors
. Added the whole section "What are all those deinterlace algorithms ?"
submitted by Muljadi Budiman and slighly updated by myself (changed the 2:2
pulldown part). Developers please check out the part you're related to.
. Added a part to "Can I use more than one video input" suggesting usage of
an a/v receiver to switch between multiple video inputs
. Added "how much dvd costs ?"
