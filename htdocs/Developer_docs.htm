      <p>First of all welcome to dTV development!&nbsp; If you have any interest 
        in video and TV I'm sure you will find working on dTV rewarding.&nbsp; 
        There is a pretty steep learning curve but what you learn will be useful 
        in every area of your home theater hobby.</p>
      <h2><br>
        Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>You must be a proficient C programmer with some knowledge of windows 
        programming.&nbsp; dTV is probably not a good project to cut your teeth 
        on as any crashes&nbsp;while developing causes your computer to hang.&nbsp; 
        Be careful and back up your machine regularly.</p>
      <p>You must have access to a version of Microsoft Visual C++ and the latest 
        source.</p>
      <h2><br>
        Background Reading</h2>
      <p>The software talks directly to the bt8x8 chip on whatever PCI card you 
        have installed.&nbsp; It would be very sensible to read the data sheet 
        for this card to get an idea of how the chip works and hopefully be able 
        to work out some of the code.&nbsp; Get the datasheet from <a href="http://www.conexant.com/techinfo/ShowFiles.asp?ID=108&amp;ST=C">Conexant</a>.</p>
      <p>The code for the linux drivers that forms the basis for Multidec can 
        be found <a href="http://me.in-berlin.de/~kraxel/bttv.html">here</a>.&nbsp; 
        This is a much later version than the one used by MultiDec so it is more 
        than possible that bugs have been fixed. The functions starting BT848_ 
        in the code should map to a similarly named function in the file bttv_driver.c.</p>
      <p>This <a href="http://www.video-demystified.com/mm/tutor/ch08.pdf">chapter 
        from Video Demystified</a> describes in detail both VideoText and closed 
        captions as well as full details of NTSC, PAL and SECAM.&nbsp; Without 
        this the VBI code will be imposiible to understand.</p>
      <p>This <a href="ftp://telepresence.dmem.strath.ac.uk/pub/bt848/spec/">FTP 
        site</a> contains documents on the MSP sound chips and Phillips and Temic 
        tuners that would be useful for anyone looking to improve these areas.&nbsp; 
        I only recently found this site and have had a quick look and found that 
        most of the information you need should be buried in this lot.&nbsp;</p>
      <h2><br>
        File by File</h2>
      <p>Audio.c - Deals with the sound.&nbsp; The function Audio_SetSource selects 
        the sound channel output by the card.&nbsp; For cards with an MSP chip 
        there are several other functions to deals with the features of those 
        chips. None of this code has been tested by me.</p>
      <p>bt848.c - Deals with low level and chip specific details, don't even 
        bother looking in here if you haven't got the datasheet.</p>
      <p>bTVPlugin.c - Adds abilty to call bTV plugins.</p>
      <p>ccdecode.c - Very early Closed Caption decoder, read the description 
        of CC in the Video Demystified first and then see if you can work out 
        what the code is trying to do.&nbsp; The code is untested and there have 
        been no reported successes with it.</p>
      <p>DebugLog.c - Adds the ability to output formatted strings to the dTVLog.txt 
        file to assist in debugging.&nbsp; To use Logging you must place a #define 
        DOLOGGING at the top of the file you wish to include logging and then 
        use the LOG function which works like printf.</p>
      <p>Deinterlace.c - Contains the assembler code used for deinterlacing and 
        for auto pulldown detection.&nbsp; The assembler makes heavy use of MMX 
        instructions.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you know basic x86 assembler and want to find 
        out about the new instruction see the <a href="http://developer.intel.com/design/pro/MANUALS/refer.htm">Intel 
        Developer Manuals</a> Volume 2 has a description of all the instructions.</p>
      <p>Dialogs.c - Contains the code for most of the simple dialogs used by 
        the menus.</p>
      <p><b>dTV.c</b> - Contains the Main windows event handler and WinMain.&nbsp; 
        This file is the best place to start to get a feel for how the software 
        functions at a high level.</p>
      <p>ErrorBox.c - Simple error handling message box.</p>
      <p>Globals.c - Globals not allocated to a particular source file are initialized 
        here.</p>
      <p>i2c.c - This code implements the I2C protocol which is used to talk to 
        other components on the card like to tuner or sound chips. Should be no 
        reason to change anything in here.</p>
      <p>MixerDev.c - Lots of code to control the sound cards mixer through windows 
        API code.&nbsp; I haven't touched this code and have no idea how it works.</p>
      <p>Other.c - Was used by me as a bucket to place code, now contains just 
        the overlay handling code.</p>
      <p><b>OutThread.c</b> - This is where the main logic of the display code 
        is.&nbsp; Al the auto detection and flipping is handled in here.&nbsp; 
        This would be the file I expect to change the most and would be a good 
        second file to take a look at.&nbsp; The main functions are YUVOutThreadPAL 
        and YUVOutThreadNTSC</p>
      <p>ProgramList.c - Handles the Program List dialog box.&nbsp; This could 
        definitely do with improvement.</p>
      <p>Settings.c - Loads and saves settings to the dTV ini file.&nbsp; Contains 
        defaults for some settings.</p>
      <p>Status.c - Code for the status bar.&nbsp; should be OK</p>
      <p>Tuner.c - Handles the tuner and also the country settings.&nbsp; This 
        area could be massively improved.&nbsp; There is a file channels.ini which 
        should be used instead of the channels.lst file.</p>
      <p>TVCards.c - Contains the details of all the cards that should be supported 
        by dTV.&nbsp; The data is taken from the bttv driver so check that they 
        haven't changed their values.&nbsp; The structures are similar but not 
        exactly the same so check that the values are being transposed properly.</p>
      <p>vbi.c - High level VBI decoding. VBI_DecodeLine is the high level function.</p>
      <p>vt.c - VideoText decoder</p>
      <h2><br>
        Comments</h2>
      <p>Code that is commented with new style comments (//) has been done by 
        me.&nbsp; The old style comments (/* */) were from the original code.</p>
      <p>My long term aim is to move the code over to C++, my moves towards this 
        are by the naming convention where the public functions of a c file are 
        that file name followed by an&nbsp; underscore e.g. BT848_ResetHardware() 
        will eventually become m_BT848-&gt;ResetHardware().&nbsp; This should 
        reduce the huge number of global variables use throughout the program 
        without impacting performance too much.</p>
      <p>Sound chip support needs a lot of further investigation.&nbsp; The code 
        in bttv is probably a good place to start.&nbsp; Note that bttv supports 
        many different sound chips, These could be added in a similar way to the 
        MSP chip but you're on your own.</p>
      <p>Tuner support also need a lot of work.&nbsp; There is no support currently 
        for fine tuning or manual channel setup.</p>
      <p>The variable TVSettings (initialized in Global.c) contains the screen 
        sizes and timing for the different video formats.&nbsp; The setting in 
        1.6 were calibrated to my DX2 cards NTSC output.&nbsp; The PAL settings 
        have not been optimized for DVD/LD and are at a higher resolution.&nbsp; 
        If you want to add a new format put it here.&nbsp; Or if the other settings 
        do not work try changes here.</p>
