#Instructions for initial run...
#cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs1:/cvsroot/deinterlace login <Enter> (See below for discussion)
#cp /home/groups/d/de/deinterlace/htdocs/scripts/webup.sh
#   /home/users/firstletterusername/firsttwolettersusername/yourusername/ <Enter>
#cd /home/users/firstletterofyourusername/firsttwolettersofusername/yourusername/ <Enter>
#sh webup.sh <Enter>

#Instructions for subsequent runs...
#sh webup.sh <Enter>

#A note about permissions and the cron...
#You will need to give the cron adequate permissions to run the script, if you
#schedule it in crontab.

#A note about error messages...
#This script is noisy and verbose.  Don't worry about the error messages.


#===Getting down to business===


#Do the work from the dScaler subdirectory

cd /home/groups/d/de/deinterlace/


#Delete the previous live site.
#Make sure you add add'l htdocs subdirectories to this list, if you add them to CVS.
#But DON'T delete the htdocs/webalizer directory, since that is not in the CVS.
#If you delete it, then you will have to reconstruct it from the logs, an extremely
#laborious process.

#Note 5/13/2001: Sourceforge no longer exposes the log files for Webalizer.  Old
#statistics are still kept on dScaler's webalizer page, but are no longer updating.
#One of these days, Sourceforge will install a complete web site stats package
#and we will again have accurate usage info, etc.

#Check out the htdocs module from the dScaler CVS using pserver.
#You will need to log in to pserver once; after that, you should be fine, unless the CVS
#server crashes or something like that.  In a half year, I've had to log in a couple of times.
#See the instructions above for the details on logging in.
