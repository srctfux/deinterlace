#This file is the DOS FTP script to grab the dTV nightly source zip from
#the dTV anonymous FTP site on Sourceforge.

#Execute this file by using the command from the batch file or command line:
#'ftp -A -s:fgetdtv.txt deinterlace.sourceforge.net <Enter>'

#Because of this explanatory text, ftp will throw a lot of errors, but
#disregard them.


#---Start Here


#Change to binary for the zip file

binary


#ftp deinterlace.sourceforge.net maps to the absolute path /home/ftp/
#on the Sourceforge servers.  The project files are found, however,
#at /home/ftp/pub/deinterlace, so do our work from there.

cd pub/deinterlace


#Grab the nightly source zip from the server

get dtvmodule.zip


#Logout from the server

quit


#Joy
