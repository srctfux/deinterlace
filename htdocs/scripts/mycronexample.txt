#This is an example cron file to run some dTV site maintenance.
#
#First, it runs the webup.sh script, which updates the site from the CVS.  This cron file specifies it to
#run every hour on the hour.  Currently, Sourceforge's permissions are broken, so this script doesn't work
#right now.  They will fix it as they build out the system.
#
#Second, it runs the runlogs.sh script, which updates the Webalizer site statistics html pages and creates
#add'l ones as specified in the webalizer.conf file in the /htdocs/webalizer directory.  This cron file
#specifies that the script runs on the 55th minute of the 23rd hour of each day (2:55 AM Eastern).
#
#Third, it runs the zipmodule.sh script, which does a nightly source zip and places the file on anonymous
#FTP.  This is run on the 9th and 21st hour of server time (noon and midnight Eastern).
#
#This file specifies that all output from running scripts is sent to a logs e-mail address, in case the
#script doesn't run correctly and you need to troubleshoot.  Currently, this feature is broken in
#Sourceforge, but should be reimplemented soon as they build out their new system.
#
#Modify this file so that it points to the proper script locations in your user directory.
#
#After reading these instructions, delete them from the file before entering the file into the crontab.
#Enter the file into the crontab by typing 'crontab mycronexample.txt <Enter>'
#
#NB:  make sure that the last line of the file has a newline after it.  Crontab doesn't like a clean
#end-of-file
