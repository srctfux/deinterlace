<h1><br>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Where can I find the latest FAQ ?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.dscaler.org/FAQ.htm">Here at
http://www.dscaler.org/FAQ.htm</a></p>

<h2>What is DScaler ?</h2>

<p>DScaler is a piece of software that grabs analog, interlaced
video, and deinterlaces it to make it a progressive scan feed
then allows scaling to any resolution for use on your computer
monitor or projector.</p>

<p>Analog, interlaced video is what devices like VCRs, laserdisc,
and game consoles output.</p>

<h2>What is so special about DScaler ?</h2>

<p>Unlike most existing software for use with TV cards, DScaler
implements sophisticated deinterlacing algorithms. Using such
algorithms makes sure that each kind of video source is handled a
different way. It provides the user with a level of image quality
unknown to PC owners until now.</p>

<p>Some of the techniques are:</p>

<ul>
<li>video source deinterlacing</li>

<li>inverse telecine detection: 2:2 (for pal movies) as well as
3:2 (for ntsc movies) pulldown</li>

<li>Automatic aspect ratio control</li>

<li>Judder elimination</li>
</ul>

<p>The image quality resulting from those complex operations is
high and allows some people equipped with data capable projectors
to feed them with progressive scan images.</p>

<h2>What is dTV ?</h2>

<p>dTV is the old name for DScaler, we changed the name as people
use dTV to refer to digital television and this was causing
confusion. In the source and on the website you will still see
references to dTV but please refer to the program as DScaler from
now on.</p>

<h2>History of DScaler</h2>

<p>The whole thing started in July 2000. See Cliff Watson's post
regarding the home theater computer history in "<a href=
"http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/012706.html#7">Who are
the pioneers of htpc ?</a>". Ali, one of the first French htpc
addicts, was promoting a piece of software called <a href=
"http://www.borgtech.org/">BorgTV</a> (aka bTV) that allowed him
to deinterlace analog sources with a level of quality unknown at
this time. Thanks to threads like "<a href=
"http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Archives/Archive-000004/HTML/20010102-12-002950.html">
Not so bad analog video deinterlacing with htpc</a>", people got
interested in the subject. Among them was <a href=
"Authors.htm">John Adcock</a>.</p>

<p>He released a plugin for bTV that was doing realtime 2:2
pulldown for PAL movies that showed that deinterlacing of such
sources was feasable in software (see "<a href=
"http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Archives/Archive-000004/HTML/20010102-12-003461.html">
John Adock's great PALMovie plugin</a>").</p>

<p>The lack of NTSC support in bTV made the implementation of the
more complex 3:2 pulldown algorithm lead John to write his own
application based on Multidec. Its name, based on its inspiration
application, was dTV (see "<a href=
"http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Archives/Archive-000004/HTML/20010714-12-003790.html">
First Version of NTSC/PAL TV deinterlacing program</a>").</p>

<p>The first versions only had manual film pulldown selction.  The next major
breakthrough was when John implemented Mark Rejhon's 3:2 pulldown algorithm.</p>

<p>This proved that complex deinterlacing techniques could be
done in realtime and without additionnal dedicated hardware.
Since this time, more and more users (and coders) have joined the
dTV community and are using it on their htpc rather than using
external line doublers.</p>

<p>In may 2001, <a href=
"http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/010323.html">dTV got
renamed to DScaler</a> to avoid any misunderstanding with the
growing Digital TeleVision issue.</p>

<p>See <a href="Authors.htm">Authors</a> for the main
contributors and <a href="Thanks.htm">Thanks</a> for a list of
people who have helped make DScaler a success.</p>

<h2>How much does DScaler cost ?</h2>

<p>DScaler is free software, open-source, coded under the <a href=
"http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL Licence</a>.</p>

<h2>What do I do if I want to pay for it ?</h2>

<p>While the developers in no way oblige you to, we would suggest that you 
support <a href=http://www.eff.org/>Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> by making 
a contribution <a href=http://www.eff.org/support>here</a>

<p>We can't promise anything in return except to try to give a small preference 
to support requests, but you'll have our appreciation and know you've helped keep 
cyberspace free of barbed wire and bull***t.</p>

<h2>Can I ship DScaler with machines I make ?<br>
Can I redistribute DScaler ?</h2>

<p>DScaler is released under the <a href=
"http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> and as such
you are free to redistribute DScaler provided you agree to also
distribute the source code. Note that simple linking to our site
is not enough. Also it would be nice to <a href=
"mailto:deinterlace-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net">hear</a> from
anybody who is shipping this product as we can add a link to your
site and keep track of who is using our software.</p>

<h2>Where can I download DScaler?</h2>

<p>Official releases are placed on DScaler's site, on the <a
href="http://www.dscaler.org/downloads.htm">download page</a></p>

<p>From time to time the developers release alpha test versions,
these version are often unstable but will have all the latest
features. These versions are not recommended generally and are
only supported via the developers mailing list. The test
downloads can be found <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7420">here</a></p>

<h1>General issues</h1>

<h2>Should I use DScaler to deinterlace the output from my
set-top dvd player ?</h2>

<p>While it is feasible and works quite well (see the "DScaler
Windvd challenge" in the <a href=
"http://www.dscaler.org/screenshots/index.htm">screenshots</a>
section), home theatre PC's have shown the best results while
using dvd decoding software along with a dvd-rom and a modern
graphics card. However, there are people who find it easier
to use with DScaler with an external DVD player.</p>

<p>Some people have found that DScaler does a better job with
non-film DVDs (e.g. concert videos or DVDs of some television shows) and 
poorly coded DVDs (e.g. Anime) than the software players.</p>

<p>Note that most DVD players implement Macrovision copy controls, these 
can interfere with DScaler.  For futher information see <a href="#PURPLESTRIPES">"What is the purple 
stripes issue ?"</a> below</p>

<h1>Software issues</h1>

<h2>Which operating system can I use DScaler on ?</h2>

<p>Windows 95 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0, may need ie 4.0
installed</i><br>
 Windows 98 ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
 Windows NT ?? <i>may require hacked DirectX 5.0</i><br>
 Windows Me ok <i>uses VxD running in ring-0</i><br>
 Windows 2000 ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br>
 Windows XP ok <i>uses sys running in ring-0</i><br>
 Linux no <i>if you want to do a port <a href="#HELP">contact
us</a></i><br>
 OS/2 definitely no ;-)</p>

<h2>What are all those deinterlace algorithms ?</h2>

<h3>Video Deinterlace (Bob)</h3>

<p>This method is based on Gunnar Thalin's VirtualDub filter.  If
it detects weaving artifacts in the current image it uses bob to
get rid of them.  This method has a tendency to bob rather too
much and gives poor results on fine static images.</p>

<h3>Video Deinterlace (Weave)</h3>

<p>Similar to Video Deinterlace (Bob), however this method has a
tendency to weave on moving images.</p>

<h3>Video Deinterlace (2-Frame)</h3>

<p>This method uses the current frame and the last two to
determine whether to bob or weave a given pixel. This gives
better results on both stationary and moving images than the
above two methods however it uses more CPU.</p>

<h3>Simple Weave</h3>

<p>This method just combines the most recent even and odd
fields.  This causes motion artifacts and is provided for
comparison.</p>

<h3>Simple Bob</h3>

<p>This uses only the most recent field and fills the lines in
between with interpolated pixels.  This method has in may ways
been superceded by Scaler BOB.</p>

<h3>Blended Clip</h3>

<p>The BLENDED CLIP Deinterlace method is designed mostly for
experimentation by those interested in what works for video
deinterlacing. When it is selected it will pop up a control panel
with many controls to adjust various parameters. These all
correspond to Blc... parameters in the [Deinterlace] section of
the DScaler.ini file and are documented there. It is probably not
the single best method for anything but it can be used to create
custom deinterlace methods for special purposes. These can be
saved in a separate ini file and invoked by a command line
parameter when starting DScaler.exe. Somewhat CPU intensive</p>

<h3>Scaler Bob</h3>

<p>Uses the DirectDraw hardware bob feature (if available), this
uses the current field and lets the video card scaler size the
picture to fit the screen.  Produces good results for fast moving
images.</p>

<h3>Even Fields Only<br>
 Odd Fields Only</h3>

<p>These use only one field out of each pair and use hardware
scaling.  This reduces bob artifacts at the cost of loss of
information.  These were originally intended to be used with game
consoles.</p>

<h3>Adaptive Deinterlace</h3>

<p>This method uses the amount of motion detected to select the
best deinterlacing alogoritm.  Currently by default it switches
between 2-Frame and weave.</p>

<h3>Greedy deinterlace method</h3>

<p>The GREEDY Deinterlace method is designed to give good results
on low motion video source, using less CPU than some others. Good
on slower machines but it will give awful results on high motion
video material like sports. Quite by accident, it can also do a
decent job on poorly mastered 3:2 or 2:2 pull down film source
material like some anime movies, regardless of low or high
motion. Try it if you have a movie source that is not giving good
results with normal Auto Pull Down processing.</p>

<h3>Greedy 2 Frame method</h3>

<p>This method tries to combine the best features of the 2-frame
algorithm with the looking ahead ability of the greedy method.  I
find this methods works well on sports and other high motion
material.  With static images and low quality sources there may
be unacceptable levels of bobbing.</p>

<h3>3:2 Pulldown, Skip Field X</h3>

<p>Mostly on NTSC format, on a 24-fps film material, the material
is encoded as 48 fields (24 odd and 24 even). Each frame will be
alternatingly played 3 and 2 times respectively. With regard to
fields, the order played will be come: Odd, Even, Odd (of frame
1) and Even, Odd (of Frame 2), and so on. In order to create a
pure progressive image (which is 1 frame of the 24-fps material),
DScaler will only need to take the odd and even field, weaves
them together, skip the next odd frame and wait until the next
odd and even field arrives, weaves them together and put it out
again. In the field sequence, out of every 5 field, 1 field can
be skipped. That field that is skipped will be the number
displayed on the pulldown Skip Field. If all the sequences are
coming in as perfect as described, and DScaler detects it
perfectly, the 3:2 pulldown method selected will always be set
the same. If the PC is rather slow (dropping fields), or the
sequence is altered (abruptly changing scenes), or DScaler's
tolerance in comparison is exceeded, it will retry to lock again
to the 3:2 pulldown, and might end up with a different field to
skip.</p>

<h3>2:2 Pulldown</h3>

<p>PAL movies are made of sequences of 2:2 frames. Once such a
sequence is detected, the Odd and Even fields are taken, weaved
to form 1 frame of the 24-fps material, and displayed.</p>

<h2>Can I <i>remote control</i> DScaler ? <b>YES</b></h2>

<p>Yes you can. DScaler is being developped mainly by people
using it as an analog source scaler for their projector and they
prefer for sure using DScaler from their remote on the sofa
rather than from their desk ;-)</p>

<p>DScaler is thus filled with <a href="keyboard.htm">keyboard
shortcuts</a> for all main options so that you can do everything
quickly.</p>

<p>We also suggest the use of <a href="http://www.girder.nl">Girder</a> 
from Ron Bessems as the application of choice for remote controlling your computer.</p>

<h2>Can I record video to my hard disk with DScaler?</h2>

<p>Sort of. DScaler now handles basic recording and playback of
specifically-formatted AVI files using a compression codec of
your choice. The end goal being a "time shifting" feature (i.e.
pausing of live TV) and not a generic video file processor. In
other words, it handles only the video files that it creates
itself for this purpose. This is all currently under
construction.</p>

<p>DScaler isn't intended to be an all-in-one desktop video
utility. The development team has chosen to concentrate on making
it the best video processor it can be.</p>

<p>If you want to record video, there are lots of alternatives to
choose from, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/">VirtualDub</a>, an
open-source desktop video application, can capture as well as
edit and post-process video.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.showshifter.com/">ShowShifter</a> for
TiVo-like features such as an integrated program guide and
pausing of live TV.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.nct.ch/multimedia/avi_io">AVI_IO</a> is a
video recording application that specializes in keeping audio
locked to video even in the face of dropped frames.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, if you want to improve DScaler's video recording,
there's nothing stopping you! That's what open source is all
about.</p>

<h1>Hardware issues</h1>

<h2>Can I use any vga card as a display device ?</h2>

<p>This is what Mark Rejhon has to say about this:</p>

<p>"DScaler requires an AGP card. It is impossible to do on a PCI
video card. DScaler uses massive amounts of *bidirectional* bus
bandwidth: 250 megabits per second incoming bandwidth (from TV
card) and about 500 megabits per second outgoing bandwidth (to
videocard). This bus data firehose is not feasible on PCI bus, as
PCI can reliably continuously transfer up to about 600-700
megabits per second *in one direction only* out of a possible
1056 megabits per second (132 megabytes per second) due to
overhead. Try to go bidirectional, and framerate literally gets
the death penalty!"</p>

<p>However, some users ahve reported that they are able to use their PCI card 
successfully and without dropped frames. 
In some cases however, frame rate goes down when higher and 
higher resolutions are tried.</p>

<p>Ian Darian reported <i>I have an 8MB 3dfusion PCI on a BX mobo
Celeron 566 64MB RAM 66MHz FSB, with Dynalink Magic TView
(Conexant 878) and can only execute DScaler at 16 bit colour
depth. When running a 1024x768 desktop, DScaler v1.9 with a
720x576 @ 50Hz PAL composite input gives 0 DFS in manual Video
De-interlace mode for DScaler window sizes up to 848x629 (as
determined from DScaler.ini) but 7+ DFS for window sizes even 1
pixel above either of these dimensions</i></p>

<p>At a minimum the display card must support YUY2 overlays. All
newer cards support this.</p>

<a name="BESTCARD"></a> 

<h2>Which capture card can I use ?</h2>

<p>Almost any card (and that means A LOT) based of former
Brooktree (now Conexant) chips including bt848/878/879 will work
for video only. Why those ? These chips are easy to program
(there has been A LOT of software based on those) and are very cheap.
This means many manufacturers have (and are
still) produced cards based on those chips.</p>

<p>Sound from the tuner is not always supported and adding this
for a lot of cards is not a developement priority.</p>

<p>While we can't (and won't) claim "this card is the one you need", here are a 
few that have been sucessfully used by some users.</p>

<ul>
<li>Zoltrix Genie TV <a href=
"http://www.zoltrix-int.com/products/video/8MMZXGENIE.htm">http://www.zoltrix-int.com/products/video/8MMZXGENIE.htm</a></li>

<li>The WinTV series from Hauppage <a href=

</ul>

<p>Take a look at the <a href=
"http://www.dscaler.org/card-support/index.htm">card list</a>.
This will never be complete so feel free to drop us an email
reporting your experience with DScaler and your card. Also note
that just because a card is on the list does not mean that it
will work properly. Some features especially sound may not work
correctly.</p>

<p><i>This list is originally based on the linux bttv driver on
which the program was originally based.</i></p>

<h2>Can I use my existing &lt;whatever&gt; card's video input
?</h2>

<p>Probably not. DScaler currently only supports the Brooktree/Conexant chipset 
(see previous question). Supporting others chipsets, while
feasable, means some hard work and some solid knowledge of those
chipsets. And <b>unfortunately, no recent vga card with video-in
feature includes Brooktree/Conexant chipset</b>. Gx00, Asus
Deluxe, ATI All-in-Wonder etc... are thus not supported for video input 
at the moment.</p>

<p>If you have some programming knowledge regarding the grab
chipsets used in those card, you might want to help us. See the
"<a href="#HELP">How can I help</a>" section.</p>

<h2>Can I use more than one video input ?</h2>

<p>Not currently although it is a work in progress.</p></p>

<p>However, you can easily use your a/v receiver to switch
between multiple video inputs. Connect the monitor out of your
equipement to your grab card and all your video devices to video
in connectors.</p>

<p>Also, some cards come with one, sometimes two composite input
that you can use separately from within DScaler. An svideo
connection is also quite common, allowing you to switch easily
from 2 or 3 sources.</p>

<p><a name="TROUBLE"></a></p>

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2>I have problems with sound?</h2>

<p>Note that support for sound from cards internal tuners is not
a priority for most of the developers of DScaler.  Almost all the
developers use some kind of external TV tuner and bypass the
sound issue.  Having said that we will be pleased to accept fixes
for any card but are not in a position to add support for new
cards ourselves.</p>

<h2>My picture jumps up and down?<br>
I get dropped frames?</h2>

<p>Both problems seem to be caused by not having a powerful
enough machine to run everything all at the same time.  The
things that use up a lot of CPU time are 2-Frame, Blended Clip & Greedy
deinterlacing and automatic pulldown detection.  Try moving to
another pulldown method or switching off autodetection.  The
other alternative is to buy a faster PC ;-))</p>

<p>There is now a setting in Select Hardware which allows you to
tell DScaler how fast your PC is.  Try selecting alower speed if
you get either of these problems.</p>

<p><a name="PURPLESTRIPES"></a></p>

<h2>What is this "purple stripes" issue ?</h2>

<p>When feeding some analog sources to the combination grab
card/DScaler, horizontal colored lines appear on
the image.</p>

<p>See <a href=
"http://www.dscaler.org/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOn.jpg">this
picture</a> where macrovision has been added to the video signal.
The same video signal <a href=
"http://www.dscaler.org/images/Mummy_MacrovisionOff.jpg">without
the macrovision protection</a> is perfectly stripes-free.</p>

<p>This phenomenom seems to be <b>more visible when a
macrovision protected video signal is fed</b> to some grab cards
but this has been reported (although less visibly) on
unprotected material.</p>

<p>Other examples of this phenomenon can be seen here ;<br>
 <a href=
"http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Archives/Archive-000004/HTML/20010323-12-004317.html">
avs:MacroVision side effect</a><br>
 <a href=
"http://www.avsforum.com/ubb/Forum12/HTML/004436.html">avs:DScaler
Purple Stripes - is this capture card dependent?</a></p>

<p>Some information from the <a href=
"http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html">Dvd Faq</a> ;</p>

<p><i>"Macrovision adds a rapidly modulated colorburst signal
("Colorstripe") along with pulses in the vertical blanking signal
("AGC") to the composite video and s-video outputs. This confuses
the synchronization and automatic-recording-level circuitry in
95% of consumer VCRs. Unfortunately, it can degrade the picture,
especially with old or nonstandard equipment. Macrovision may
show up as stripes of color, distortion, rolling, black & white
picture, and dark/light cycling. Macrovision creates problems for
many line doublers."</i></p>

<p><b>WARNING</b> This has been reported only when feeding, for
test purposes, a dvd player to the computer. Problems on other
type of sources have yet to be shown.</p>

<p>So in common cases, you don't have to worry about this.</p>

<h2>Despite having a very powerful system, I still get some
dropped frames?</h2>

<p>Some people experienced some dropped frames (signs of a
machine that has problems keeping up with the workload of
DScaler) even on powerful systems. An hypothesis is that some
motherboard agp speed issue might be the cause of such
behavior.</p>

<p>JackB reported <i>We looked at his BIOS settings and the only
major difference is that his had a 4X AGP mode and my MB only has
a 2X AGP mode. &lt;snip&gt; We put my video card, a GeForce2 MX,
in his(slower supposedly)system and it ran 0 DFS. So it's not the
MX throughput that's the problem. So, I'm down to it's my
motherboard not being up to speed in either AGP acceleration or I
have some settings set incorrectly</i></p>

<p><a name="OVERLAY"></a></p>

<h2>I get "overlay update" errors</h2>

<p>Sometimes you get this error message<br>
 <code>Error calling overlay update.
D:/source/deinterlace/DScaler/other.c at line ???</code><br>
We don't have any full explanation of the problem but it happens
when resizing DScaler or making it go from fullscreen to window
mode. Also the color depth, frequency and size of the desktop
might be related.</p>

<h2>What is the Crashlog.txt file, and where do I find it ?</h2>

<p>If one of the developers asks you for a crashlog.txt file you
should find this file in the DScaler install directory. This file
contains useful information that can be used to find bugs more
easily. If you can't find one when you've been asked for one
don't worry just inform the developer that one was not created.
Also if you have this file but are not observing problems then
don't worry.</p>

<h2>I still have a problem?</h2>

<p>See <a href="user_support.htm">Support</a> for how to get
support for DScaler.</p>

<a name="HELP"></a> 

<h1>How can I help ?</h1>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>More and more people are giving DScaler a try. Why don't
you?<br>
We'd like to know about your experience with it. What does (not)
work? What can be improved, what features you would like. All
feedback is useful.</p>

<p>Please report bugs on the <a href=
"http://www.avsforum.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi">AV Science
Forum</a> after checking (using the search feature) that the
problem has not already been reported. Each bug report should
include the hardware you're using, especially video card, grab
card and processor type and speed.</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>Any help is welcome. Despite including some very complex code,
there are a lot of features in that are simple or that could
be easily implemented without having to wade through all the assembler.</p>

<p>If you've got an idea, or feel like to trying to implement
something that is already in the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/pm/task.php?group_project_id=7174&group_id=7420&func=browse">
Tasks list</a>, join the <a href=
