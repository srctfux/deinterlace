<p>This method improves the display of video games from old
consoles on your computer. Instead of deinterlacing like most
DScaler plugins, it smooths vertically. That gets rid of the
weird jittering you'd otherwise see. It works nicely with just
about any game on a PlayStation, Super Nintendo, or Genesis.
Presumably, it will work well with a Nintendo 64, Saturn, Atari,
NES, Megadrive, and so on. Just don't try it with your
Vectrex.</p>

<p>More exactly, this plugin assumes that you're looking at a
progressive half height image. So any video source which fits
that description should work well. The Old Game method is similar
to the OddOnly and EvenOnly plugins, but improves the picture in
a couple ways. First, it works well with material running at any
FPS (frames per second) rate, instead of just 25 or 30 FPS.
Second, it optionally uses averaging between frames to reduce
noise and color crosstalk. Averaging is an especially nice
improvement if you've connected your console with a composite
connector. The averaging works well alone or along with a noise
filter.</p>

<p>Later consoles such as the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, GameCube,
or XBox use interlaced output, and will look lousy with this
plugin. (Well, some of them allow progressive output, too, but
not in a way the supported input cards can understand.) To play
them on your computer, use the more standard deinterlacing
plugins. The Super Nintendo, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Saturn
can also use an interlaced mode. The PlayStation uses interlaced
mode for its startup logo, for example. But almost all games
switch back into progressive half height mode for the main play
of the game. Automatic sensing of the interlace mode is something
I'd like to add in the future.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Who Should Use
It?</font></b></p>

<p>Anybody who plays old video games on their computer via video
input should use this plugin. (Well, at least until something
better comes along.)</p>

<p>There's a bug in some older Matrox overlay drivers which
allows the Scaler Bob plugin to work nearly as well as Old Game
for progressive half height video. It doesn't use averaging to
reduce noise, but it should run a little faster. On the other
hand, since Old Game is fast enough to run just fine on any
computer supported by DScaler, that doesn't really gain you
much.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">The Settings</font></b></p>

<p>There are two options to set for this plugin, Composite Mode
and Motion Threshold. Composite Mode forces the plugin to always
average between frames. Motion Threshold is the amount of motion
(in arbitrary units) which will convince the plugin not to
average between frames.</p>

<p>The way you should set these options depends on the way you've
connected your console.</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Composite or F-Connector</font></b></p>

<p>With a composite connection, the biggest problem by far will
be color crosstalk. To get rid of it, check (would you believe)
the Composite Mode option. That way, the crosstalk will be
averaged out. This makes the picture look much, much nicer.</p>

<p>With Composite Mode checked, the Motion Threshold slider won't
do anything at all.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the Temporal Comb plugin doesn't help at all for
crosstalk in most old video games. That's for an obscure
technical reason involving the phase of the color carrier signal
and the number of scanlines per frame.</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">S-video</font></b></p>

<p>With an S-video connection, you shouldn't see much color
crosstalk. So you can afford to use the slider to prevent
averaging when the scene is moving. Turn off the Composite Mode
option and set Motion Threshold to about 300. Increase it a bit
if you have a noisy picture (and turn on a noise filter) , or
decrease it if you see blurring during fast motion.</p>
