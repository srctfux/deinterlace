      <h1>Currently Active developers</h1>

      <h2>John Adcock</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>John is the founder and maintainer of the project. He did almost all
        of the work cleaning, translating and legalizing Multidec to create the
        first versions of dTV. He coded the world's first real-time software
        3:2 pulldown software deinterlacer(based on Mark Rejhon's algorithm
        article). He has also designed several video-material deinterlacers
        that are superior to those in virtually any other any PC-based video
        software product.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Laurent Garnier</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>In his time off from being confused with the similarly named French
        DJ, Laurent has been very busy adding some of the coolest new features
        in recent releases: auto-calibration, the OSD (On Screen Display), WSS
        (WideScreen Signalling), stills source and patterns.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Torbjörn Jansson</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Added the new generic settings dialog and has provided many bug
        fixes</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Rob Muller</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Rob has quickly established himself as a core part of the team. He
        has fixed problems all over the code and also provided the new setup
        routine.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Atsushi Nakagawa</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Atsushi added support for Philips' SAA7130/4 based cards. He is now
        one of the driving forces behind the project.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Torsten Seeboth</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Torsten keeps himself busy getting the cx2388x cards working
        properly, he is the main reason any of these cards work.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h1>Previous Contributors</h1>

      <h2>Mark Rejhon</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Mark authored the 3:2 pulldown algorithm that forms the basis of the
        algorithm implemented into DScaler by John Adcock. He maintained the
        project for three months and during that time made a huge contribution
        to the project. Although Mark is less active on the project now he
        still pops up regularly to offer sage advice and to share his enormous
        knowledge and passion for the perfect image.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Steve Grimm</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Steve contributed major enhancements to the film detection code
        including better automatic switching between video mode and 3:2
        pulldown mode, and handling of material that has bad 3:2 pulldown.
        Steve also made significant modifications to the deinterlacing
        algorithms in version 2.0.0 creating the two frame algorithm. He also
        worked on an early version of a 3:2 pulldown deinterlacing algorithm.
        In addition, he is the author of the aspect ratio auto detection code
        which was included in version 1.9.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Tom Barry</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>As part of Tom's ongoing mission to use up all the world's CPU power
        he is behind many of the video deinterlacing plug-ins. Tom has been
        part of the project almost since the beginning and has contributed too
        much to summarize quickly.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Michael Samblanet</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Michael is continuing to upgrade his aspect ratio control code.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Michael Eskin</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>An engineer working at Conexant Systems Inc., the makers of the 8x8
        series chips that DScaler runs on.&nbsp; He basically meditates peace
        between the DScaler software and the 8x8 video capture hardware.&nbsp;
        When any of us fails on a nasty 8x8 issue, he takes over and gets the
        job done from time to time.&nbsp; One of his several valuable
        contributions include a bug fix to make Macrovision-encoded sources
        watchable in DScaler, without purple-lines interference.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Eric Schmidt</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Eric's major contribution has been the timeshifting code.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Lindsey Dubb</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The brains behind the new Temporal Comb Filter and the old game
        plug-in.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Jochen Trenner</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Provided improvements to the MSP code for European stereo systems as
        his alter ego "Hermes Conrad".</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Mike Temperton</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Is responsible for the many improvements to Teletext.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Muljadi Budiman</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Added support for overlay colour controls.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Please see the <a href="Thanks.htm">Thanks</a> file for an incomplete
      list of the many others who have contributed time and effort.</p>
